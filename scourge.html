var content = "(Whip) In a dream, a scourge means fulfilling one’s needs, attaining one’s goal, or subjugating one’s enemy to accept one’s conditions. If one’s scourge is cut in two pieces during a fight, or while lashing someone in a dream, it means loss of power. If the rope splits, it means weakening of one’s authority. If one sees himself driving an animal with a whip in a dream, it means praying to Almighty God to ease his burdens and to facilitate his earnings. If one sees himself riding a horse and hitting him hard with a scourge in a dream, it means that he is in dire need and is praying for a way out of his difficulties. If one sees himself lashing a sittingperson with a scourge in a dream, it means admonishing him, and if the other person is scared, or if he shields his face with his arm in the dream, it means repentance from sin. If he is not hurt by the scourge in the dream, it means that he is stubborn and does not accept the good advice. If he bleeds in the dream, it means that he is beaten unjustly. If the victim’s blood splashes and stains one’s clothes in the dream, it means that he will receive suspicious or unlawful money from his victim. If one’s scourge is bent in the dream, it means a mental disorder, or that one’s assistant is a reckless or an impatient person.";
