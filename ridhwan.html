var content = "(The archangel Ridhwan. peace be upon him.) Seeing the guardian angel of paradise in a dream means blessings and comfort in one’s life, glad tidings, an unalterable happiness, and protection from illness. In a dream, Ridhwan (uwbp) represents the treasurer of the king and his messenger, seeing him also could mean fulfilling a promise, or satisfying one’s needs. If one has disagreements with his superiors then if he sees Ridhwan (uwbp) in a dream, it means that they will wind up in blessings and harmony, and particularly if Ridhwan (uwbp) hands the person a heavenly fruit or a heavenly garment, or meets him cheerfully with a comforting smile, showing a sign of God’s pleasure with him. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also denotes a divine grace which is bestowed secretly and openly upon the one who sees him. Seeing Ridhwan (uwbp) in a dream also denotes a happy life, joy, peace, comfort and blessings in this world and in the next. If one sees the heavenly angels coming before him to congratulate him in a dream, it means that God Almighty has forgiven that person his sins and endowed him with the gift of patience and forbearance through which he will triumph in this life and be blessed in the next. (Also see Paradise)";
