var content = "Dreaming of trunks, foretells journeys and ill luck. To pack your trunk, denotes that you will soon go on a pleasant trip. To see the contents of a trunk thrown about in disorder, foretells quarrels, and a hasty journey from which only dissatisfaction will accrue. Empty trunks foretell disappointment in love and marriage. For a drummer to check his trunk, is an omen of advancement and comfort. If he finds that his trunk is too small for his wares, he will soon hear of his promotion, and his desires will reach gratification. For a young woman Dreaming that she tries to unlock her trunk and can’t, signifies that she will make an effort to win some wealthy person, but by a misadventure she will lose her chance. If she fails to lock her trunk, she will be disappointed in making a desired trip. ";
