To be on a train and it appears to move smoothly along, though there is no track, denotes that you will be much worried over some affair which will eventually prove a source of profit to you. To see freight trains in your dreams, is an omen of changes which will tend to your elevation. To find yourself, in a dream, on top of a sleeping car, denotes you will make a journey with an unpleasant companion, with whom you will spend money and time that could be used in a more profitable and congenial way, and whom you will seek to avoid. I had a dream that NYC train where parked at a station then a lady walks through the tracks which was weird to me then the train starts me knowing omg she is going to get hit I turn my face Then hear her body splat &amp; people screaming her blood got on people except me it was scary.The night before I had a dream of doing training to be a police or correctional officer then it switched to a  woman got beat to death by her boyfriend he locked her in a room &amp; I was outside the door finding a way to get her out but it was too late.I love to sing but I have been thinking about doing something that help people. I don’t know why I dream these horrible things it is disgusting. ";
