var content = "If you dream of bending it shows your capability to adjust to new surroundings. Pay attention to witch direction you were bending, as this would give the clue about tendency of your intentions while doing something, as if you were bending forward it means that you are not afraid to take initiative into your hands and be a leader of the situation. Otherwise, if you were bending backwards, it indicates laziness and passivity. These are the features you have at the moment, but it is never too late to change yourself for better improvement at various situations in your life.";
