var content = "In a dream, pebbles represent men, women, little children, or counted money. They also mean memorizing a book of knowledge, understanding it, knowing it by heart, or writing poems. They also mean performing one’s pilgrimage to Mecca and pelting stones in the valley of Mina at a placed called Jamarat. Pelting stones in a dream also means harshness, toughness, slander, or youth. Collecting pebbles for pelting from a marketplace, a street, under the trees, or in a farmland in a dream means receiving financial benefits. Collecting pebbles at the foot of a tree in a dream means receiving a gift from a person in authority, or profits from the sea, learning at the hand of a good teacher, a gift from a wealthy wife, or they could mean the birth of a son if one does not have a son. Throwing pebbles in the sea in a dream means wasting one’s money. Throwing pebbles in a well in a dream means benefiting from a marriage or a business. (Also see Gravel, Pelting stones)";
