var content = "(God’s prophet Liit | Nephew of God’s prophet and bosom friend Abraham, upon both of them be peace) Seeing the prophet Lot in a dream means distress and trouble caused by one’s own people and wife, or perhaps it could mean victory over one’s enemy and witnessing God’s wrath toward them. Seeing the prophet Lot in a dream also denotes obliteration of a nation, effacement, earthquake and destruction if the people who displease their Lord and follow the conduct of the dwellers of the two cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Seeing the prophet Lot’s wife in a dream means that one’s wife will rebel against him and strive to destroy his life and perhaps she will also be destroyed during that process. If everyone sees Lot’s wife in a dream, it means that evil will spread among the women of that land. Seeing the prophet Lot, upon whom be peace, in a dream also denotes a warning against sodomy, and it means that one’s wife is a corrupt woman.";
