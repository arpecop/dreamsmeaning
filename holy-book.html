var content = "(Qur’an | The Last Revelation) In a dream, the Holy Book, or the Qur’an represents a king or a judge who deals with Islamic jurisprudence. If a king, a ruler, or a judge sees that the Holy Book does no longer exist, or if he sees it burning, or if its contents are washed away in a dream, it means his death. If one sees a ruler or a governor handwriting a copy of the Holy Book in a dream, it means that he is a just person who uses the divine laws in making his decision. If a judge sees himself handwriting a copy of the Holy Book in a dream, it means that he does not share his knowledge, and that he is audacious about his rank and status. If a religious scholar or a theologian sees himself writing a copy of Holy Book in a dream, it means that he will profit from a business deal. If one sees a king, or a ruler swallowing the Holy Book in a dream, it means that he may die soon. If a judge swallows the Holy Book in a dream, it means that he accepts bribes. If a ruler sees himself erasing what is written in the Holy Book in a dream, it means that he will be exiled. If a judge erases what is written in the Holy Book in a dream, it also means his death. If he erases it by licking it with his own tongue in a dream, it means that he will commit an awful sin. If a witness erases it in a dream, it means that he will deny his own testimony. Carrying the Holy Book, or buying a copy of the Qur’an in a dream means living by its criterion. Reading from the Holy Book before God’s Prophet, upon whom be peace, in a dream means that one will commit himself to memorizing it. Eating the pages of the Holy Book in a dream means accepting bribes. If a layman eats the pages of the Holy Book, or few lines from some pages in a dream, it means that he earns his livelihood from reciting the Holy Qur’an or teaching it. Eating the pages of the Holy Book in a dream also means earning one’s livelihood from copying and selling it. Seeing the Holy Book in a dream also mans growing in wisdom. Handwriting copies of the Holy Book in a dream denotes one’s piety, or it could represent a religious scholar who lives by the book, act by its commands and shares his knowledge with others. Tearing off the pages of the Holy Book in a dream means ingratitude toward God’s revelations, or denying God’s favors, or questioning some of them. If one does something to the Holy Book in his dream that he would abhor to do in wakefulness, it means that he has lost his religious devotion and faith. Carrying a copy of the Holy Book in a dream means attaining power and acquiring knowledge. The Holy Book in a dream also represents a husband, a wife, a son, or wealth. If a sick person sees it in his dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. If the one who sees it in his dream is facing an enemy, it means that he will triumph over him. If he is a sinner, it means that he will repent of his sins and turn to his Lord, or it could mean that he may receive an inheritance. If one sees himself following innovations and he recognizes that in his sleep, his dream denotes a warning from God Almighty. Seeing the Holy Book in a dream also could mean seeing wonders, witnessing a miracle, hearing news, receiving happy news, or it could mean longevity for one who browse through it from cover to cover in his dream. The Holy Book in a dream also represents gardens, heavens, places of worship, or a person one is commanded to obey, such as a ruler, or a father, a mother, one’s teacher, or shaikh, or it could mean making a true oath, receiving glad tidings, admonition or a warning. Seeing the Holy Book or any of the early divine revelations in a dream means that one may preside over people. If one sees himself carrying the Holy Book, or even any book of revelations, and if when he opens it finds the pages blank with no writing inside it in the dream, it means that he portrays himself to be what he is not, or that he impersonates a scholar, or pretends to be religious. Kissing the Holy Book in a dream means revering what it contains and adhering to what it commands. If one looks into the pages of the Holy Book and finds its lines crooked in a dream, it means that he lives satisfied with what he has, and fulfills his required duties accordingly. Stealing a copy of the Holy Book and hiding it in a dream means that one cheats in performing his own prayers, or fails to do them properly. If one sees himself looking in the Holy Book, then writing from what he is reading on his own garment in the dream, it means that he interprets the Qur’anic revelation according to his own liking. If one sees a Holy Book sitting in his lap, then if a chick comes and picks all the words written therein in a dream, it means that one will beget a child who will memorize and read the Holy Qur’an as an inheritance, and benefit from the piety of his father, and as a trust, a lawful earning and a source of strength in his life. Buying a copy of the Holy Book in dream means benefits, prosperity and becoming a renowned and a distinguished religious scholar. If the Holy Book is snatched away from someone’s hands in a dream, it means that he will lose his knowledge, or perhaps lose his employment. If one sees himself spreading the pages of the Holy Book on a flat surface in a dream, it means that he is seeking wisdom which he will get, or that he may receive an inheritance. If one sees himself putting the Holy Book over his shoulders in a dream, it means that he will receive an appointment, or be entrusted with a duty to guard, or that he will memorize the Holy Qur’an. If one finds himself trying to eat the pages of the Holy Book in a dream, it means that he is a regular reader of the Qur’an. If one sees himself trying to eat the pages of the holy Book but is unable to do so in a dream, it means that he tries to memorize the Holy Qur’an from time to time but keeps forgetting what he learns.
