(Also see Belt | Sting)I had a dream where I had to go to the restroom. I went to this place to go onto the internet and there was a younger guy beside me and he had his phone charging in the booth of where I was sitting. And we talked he asked me if I wanted to go on a date with him but I said no I have a boyfriend I love and a son that I had with him. And then he requested to be just friends so I said ok. Then I left to go to the bathroom and (skipping some things because I forgot) I was with some “friends” I say that because I didn’t really know them. There were 3 guys talking about porn but the one you read. They made sexual jokes because I was eating long marshmallows. Then they all had to go to the restroom. (This is still all in the restroom) when they left I saw a big welt on my face that looked like it had puss and I pinched it like a pimple and all this puss was coming out of my face then I saw a tail in my left nostril and grabbed it and pulled. 3 snakes came out and a wrapper of when I was a little kid. It was tough pulling them out too it felt like they wanted to stay in and i felt they were poisonous and that they had been born inside of me and later became adults and now I pulled them out of me. But I also felt they didn’t know they were poisonous because they never used their fangs. Then I left and saw the guy waiting for me in the rain and he gave me something and I remember thinking that my boyfriend gave me better stuff. I think it was a action now instead of a gift. What could it mean??Dream about a snake in my left leg and in my house. What do that mean?I really wonder if this dream means anything…. I dreamt of seeing a dead white snake and a dead red snake.
What does this mean?";
