var content = "(Hitching | Jerking | Lameness) Limping in a dream means becoming incapacitated, or being unable to conclude a project one is pursuing. Limping in a dream also means acquiring knowledge, understanding one’s religion, or growing in wisdom. Limping in a dream also means travels. If the limping is caused by one’s right leg in the dream, it could mean that an illness will inflict one’s son, If the limping has affected the left legin the dream, it could mean that one’s daughter will be engaged. If one has no children, or if he has no plans to travel, then limping in a dream means a warning to set back, slow down and to be careful about his next move. If one’s leg is dislocated in a dream, it means that his wife may get sick. Limping in a dream also means longevity, knowledge and religious understanding. Seeing a woman limping in a dream means receiving something deficient. The same goes if a woman sees someone limping or hopping on one foot in her dream. Limping in a dream also represents trickery, perfidy, or treason. (Also see Lameness)";
