var content = "(Fighter) In a dream, a rooster represents the man of the house and a chicken represents the lady of the house. If one is offered a rooster in a dream, it means that he will beget a son who will spend his life serving others. A rooster in a dream also represents a man of bad character who also mixes serious talk with joking, and whose words carry no weight. A rooster in a dream also represents a servant who has compassion toward his master. Receiving a rooster as a gift in a dream means making peace with a friend. If one sees himself slaughtering a rooster in a dream, it means that he does not heed the call to prayers. A rooster hence represents the caller to prayers. Seeing a rooster in a dream also denotes increase in one’s wisdom and knowledge, or frequenting the circles of knowledge. If one becomes a rooster in a dream, it means that he may die shortly, or it could mean that he will become knowledgeable about setting a timetable for the daily prayers. A rooster in a dream also represents a preacher, a reader of sermons, a singer, a man who commands good but does not practice it, a sexually obsessed person, a broker, a guard, a generous man, a man with good will and determination, or a man with a large family who gives preference to helping others, and contents himself with little.";
