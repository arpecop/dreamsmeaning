var content = "(Cellar) In a dream, one’s mouth represents his life from inception to completion. One’s mouth in a dream also represents the course of one’s livelihood and the source of his strength. Putting medicine in one’s mouth in a dream means correcting one’s life for the better. If one puts food in his mouth in a dream, it means worldly gains and profits, unless one puts something that tastes bad, or which is spoiled, then it means losses, distress and depression. Putting good and tasty food or sweets in one’s mouth in a dream means living a happy and a rich life. If one’s mouth is buckled in a dream, it means death, sickness, dumbness, silence, helplessness, or defeat. If one’s mouth looks larger than usual in the dream, it denotes growth and greater benefits, but if one’s mouth looks smaller in the dream, then it means the opposite. If one’s mouth smells good in the dream, it means speaking good words. Infection of one’s mouth in a dream means a disaster or business losses. If something nice comes out of one’s mouth in a dream, it means kindness toward others. If one sees his mouth sealed in a dream and did not know who did it, it means a scandal or defamation. In a dream, one’s mouth is interpreted in seven ways – It could mean knowledge, a coffer, a cellar, a bookcase, a market, a doorman, a minister, or a door. If a pious person sees a harness around his mouth in a dream, it means fasting from food. If an impious person sees that, it means rebuke and reprimand. (Also see Body 1)";
