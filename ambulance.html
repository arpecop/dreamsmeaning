var content = "When you dream of seeing an ambulance it represents you as risky person which is not good as this might lead you to huge difficulties while dealing with your business. This dream could also represent your denial with health issues you are having. What you should do is to make sure you are not avoiding the help you are presented, you have to stop denying what is obvious. If you dream of seeing an ambulance filled with injured people it shows that you are terrified of becoming a new and better person and leaving the old personality behind. Do not let your bad habits and aggression to get onto the others. This dream could also be the meaning that your are related to someone who doesn’t do the good influence on you, you should be aware of those people. When you see someone being hit by an ambulance, it means that some part of your spirituality is harmed and needs to be healed.";
