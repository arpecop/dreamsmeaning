var content = "(Collar | Necklace) In a dream, a neckband represents stinginess. A neckband in a dream also could represent woman’s kindness, gentleness, softness, protection and respect for her husband. Thus, for a woman, a neckband in her dream represents her husband. If her neckband is made of silver, and if it is wide, comfortable and well strapped to her neck in a dream, it denotes her husband’s generosity, richness and forbearance. If the neckband is thin, then it implies difficulties. If it is made of iron in the dream, it represents a strong person. If it is made from wood in the dream, it represents a hypocrite. If a man wears a neckband over a white or a green collar in a dream, it represents victory in his life and comfort he will receive from an unexpected source. If he is a merchant, it means profits, fame, honor and dignity. If he is a common person, then the neckband means earning respect and fame. If a tight neckband is strapped around one’s neck in a dream, it represents a stingy person no one can benefit from. If he is a learned person, it means that no one benefits from his knowledge. If he commands authority, it means that he disdains from giving true judgment. To hire a servant who wears a silver neckband in a dream means establishing a profitable business. A neckband in a dream also means impiety, or it could be a sign of trustworthiness. If a man sees himself wearing a neckband that is made of gold, silver, iron, copper or lead in a dream, it means that he has abandoned his religious trust, forsaken his covenant and has become a profligate. (Also see Necklace)";
