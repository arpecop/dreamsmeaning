var content = "Dreaming of baptism, signifies that your character needs strengthening by the practice of temperance in advocating your opinions to the disparagement of your friends. Dreaming that you are an applicant, signifies that you will humiliate your inward self for public favor. Dreaming that you see John the Baptist baptizing Christ in the Jordan, denotes that you will have a desperate mental struggle between yielding yourself to labor in meagre capacity for the sustenance of others, or follow desires which might lead you into wealth and exclusiveness. To see the Holy Ghost descending on Christ, is significant of resignation to duty and abnegation of self. If you are being baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire, means that you will be thrown into a state of terror over being discovered in some lustful engagement. ";
