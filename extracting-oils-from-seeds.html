var content = "(Grinding | Pressing) Grinding or pressing nuts or seeds to extract their oils or butter in a dream means money and prosperity. Pressing ripe olives in a dream represents one’s homeland. Pressing olives for their oil in a dream means relief from burdens or overcoming adversities, or it could represent true scholars, satisfying one’s carnal desires, engaging in wrongdoing, receiving guidance, seeing the light, walking away from darkness into light, or it could represent one’s earnings or benefits. Pressing sesame seeds or walnuts in a dream means prosperity and financial growth. Sesame oil in a dream represents a pious person who admonishes people and entices them to break their attachments to the world or to its temporary pleasures. Pressing sesame seeds in a dream also represents a successful businessman. Extracting hazelnut compound in a dream means money which is earned with hardship or it could mean money that keeps growing. (Also see Juice | Oil press | Wine press)";
