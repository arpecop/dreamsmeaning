var content = "(Penis) To look at one’s sexual organs in a dream means profits, children, fame, carnal desires, want, family, strength, virility, conduct, or longevity. If a man sees himself without a male organ in a dream, it means that he will lose a son who will either die or travel away from his father, and who will leave no tracks of his whereabouts. It also could mean that he will have no more children. If a sick person sees himself without a male organ in a dream, it means that he will die from his illness. If he is a king or a governor, it means that he will be deposed. Having two male organs in a dream means that one will beget two sons. Castration in a dream means that one will bear no more daughters. If a pregnant woman sees herself having a male organ in a dream, it means that she will beget a son. If she never had children before, it means that she is barren. If one is circumcised in a dream, it means that he will fulfil his religious covenant, or pay a debt. A pubic area which is excessively hairy in a dream represents an insolent person. Feeding one’s sexual organ in a dream means dying an ugly death. If one’s male organ turns into a female organ in a dream, it means that he has lost his virility, or that he will become submissive. If one sees himself touching his wife’s sexual organ which then turns into a male organ in a dream, it means that she may undergo an operation in relation to abnormal sexual trend. A male organ in a dream also represents a craftsman’s tools. Playing with one’s male organ in a dream means that one does not shy from God’s presence and that of His angels, or that he has forgotten about proper conduct or common moral standards, or if he is a learned person, it means that he will forget what he has learned.";
