var content = "(Door lintel | Doorplate | Threshold) In a dream, the doorstep of one’s house represents one’s power, or it could mean marriage. If one sees himself removing the doorstep of his house in a dream, it means losing his power. If he removes the door lintels of his house in a dream, it means divorcing his wife. If the door lintels are taken away and one could no longer see them in the dream, it means his death. If he can still see them in the dream, then it means a sickness from which he will recover. The door lintel in a dream also represents a woman or the house bottler. If a governor sees the doorsteps of his house being removed in a dream, it means that he will be impeached. Whatever happens to the doorsteps in a dream should be interpreted as relating to one’s wife or a woman. (Also see Threshold)";
