var content = "(Vulture) Eagle is the king of birds. Struggling with an eagle in a dream means distress, fury of one’s superior or subjugation to an unjust person. Owning an obedient, well tamed eagle in a dream means prosperity, honor and power. Owning and flying an eagle in a dream means becoming a tyrant. The scratch of an eagle in a dream means a sickness. A killed eagle in a dream means the death of a ruler. If a pregnant woman sees an eagle in her dream, it means seeing a midwife or a nurse. In a dream, an eagle also may be interpreted to represent a great ruler, a prophet or a righteous person. Hearing the cry of an eagle in a dream means a fight. Eating the flesh of an eagle or getting hold of some of its feathers in a dream means receiving money from a ruler. If an eagle catches someone and soars away with him horizontally in a dream, it means travels. If he flies away with him vertically in the dream, it means death. In a dream, an eagle also means longevity, prosperity, innovation or heedlessness. (Also see Vulture)";
