var content = "(Lawn) In a dream, grass represents religious awareness and blessings. If one sees grass growing in the palm of his hand in a dream, it means that he will discover his wife having a secret affair, and he will find her in the company of someone else. If one sees grass growing over his hand in a dream, it means that he will die shortly and grass will grow over his grave. If he sees grass growing in a place where it is not supposed to grow, such as inside one’s house or inside a mosque in a dream, it means a wedding. If one sees grass growing all over him but does not cover his ears or eyes in a dream, it means prosperity. If he sees grass growing on people’s hands or floating on water in a dream, it means a good harvest and prosperity for everyone. If weeds grow at the same time in the dream, they connote negative effects. If a sick person sees such a dream, it means that he is nearinghis death. Grass growing over one’s stomach in a dream means his death or his burial after death. If grass grows all over one’s body but does not cover his head in the dream, it means prosperity and wealth. If the grass covers one’s eyes and ears in the dream, it means that he will become heedless and loses the advantages of his religious life. The same interpretation is given if one sees feathers growing over his body. If poisonous weeds grow over one’s body in a dream, they represent an illness or death. As grass is cattle’s food and cattle represents people’s wealth, then gathering and eating grass in a dream means prosperity. If an ascetic sees himself eating grass in a dream, it means that he will revert to desiring the world and its pleasures, and consequently, he will be deceived by it. Wild grass in a dream represent bad earnings and a miserable life. Cutting and selling grass in a dream means dispelling stress and difficulties, or it could represent a police officer or a tithe collector. (Also see Meadows | Weeds)";
