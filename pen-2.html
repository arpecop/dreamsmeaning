var content = "(Pencil | Tongue) In a dream, a pen represents knowledge, learning, a child, a tradesman, or commanding what is good and forbidding what is evil. If a tradesman or a craftsman sees a pen in his dream, it means that he will be successful in his trade, or that he will preside over people of the same trade. If a tradesman earns something with a pen, or writes an invoice with it in a dream, it means that he will be protected from poverty through his trade. If a writer sees himself carrying a pen, or holding a paper, or an inkwell in a dream, it also means having a source of income, protection against poverty, earning one’s livelihood from writing, or from working under someone in authority. A pen in a dream also represents one’s manager, his controller, a cosigner, a witness in an agreement, entering into a marriage agreement, or it could represent an intelligent son who will become a famous writer. Owning a pen or receiving a one as a gift in a dream means acquiring knowledge. Then, if one proceeds to write with it in his dream, it means receiving an appointment, or occupying a position of authority. Looking at a pen one is holding in his hand and seeing another pen laying beside him in a dream denotes having a half brother, or if one’s mother is pregnant, it means that she will deliver a new son. A pen in a dream also means a guarantee. If one’s wife is pregnant, then if he sees a pen laying beside an inkwell in his dream, it means that she will beget a son. Holding a pen in a dream also means making an oath. If one’s pen is broken or scratched in a dream, it will reflect on his business, trade and livelihood. Moistening a pen from an inkwell in a dream means committing a sin. A pen in a dream also represents virtues by which one is known, or it could mean complying with a court judgement, or signing a court order, or it could represent a scholar, a judge, one’s tongue, a sword, one’s penis, a railway, generosity, abundance, human- kind, one’s confidant, or winning victory over one’s enemy. If one’s pen looks in good condition in the dream, it means that one’s oath or covenant is true. Otherwise, a defective pen in a dream represents a false oath, or a biased agreement. Apen in adream also means longevity and prosperity. (Also see Tongue)";
