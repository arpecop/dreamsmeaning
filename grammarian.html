var content = "(Linguist | Philologist) A grammarian in a dream represents preven- tive medicine, drug prescriptions, avoiding evil pranks, or it could mean a cover for one’s head. A grammarian in a dream also means embellishment of one’s words, making a flowery speech, falsification or exaggeration. Seeing a gram- marian in a dream also means balance, unbalance, gossipry, pretension and ostentatiousness. If a falsifier becomes a grammarian in a dream, it means that he will turn truthful and become known for it. If he is a heedless person, it means that he will receive guidance. If he is a sinner, it means that he will repent for his sins. I f he stammers, it means that he will prosper after having suffered from poverty. The same interpretation is given for one who suffers from dumbness. If he is sick, it means that he will recover from his illness. (Also see Linguist)";
