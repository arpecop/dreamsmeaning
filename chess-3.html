var content = "(Challenges | Game) Playing chess in a dream means mixing with all kinds of people. Playing chess in a dream also means deception, fights or a ploy. Seeing a chessboard, and if no one is playing it in a dream represents a strike, or people who are dismissed from their job. If one sees people playing it, then such people represent the leaders or the statesmen. The winner in a chess game in a dream is the winner of a political or a military maneuver. Whatever steps one takes in playing chess in a dream will be reflected in the political arena. Playing chess in a dream also could mean intending a fight, but not knowing whether he will win or lose. It also could mean facing dangerous people, so one is warned in the dream to be on guard against their tricks or ploys. Playing chess in a dream also could mean vain talk or a weak fight. If one wins in the dream, it means that he will win in wakefulness. A chess game in a dream also means a war, a fight, booty, discovering secrets, pursuing hints, gradual movement, changing con- ditions, changing temper, or it could mean travels. (Also see Backgammon | Chessboard | Chessmen)";
