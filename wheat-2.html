var content = "(Grains) In a dream, wheat means money well earned. Buying wheat in a dream means increase in one’s earnings, or in the number of his children. If one sees a ruler placing a stick and steering inside a bushel of grains in a dream, it means rising prices. Planting wheat in a dream means doing a good deed for God’s pleasure. Walking in wheat fields in a dream means offering a service to God Almighty. If one plants wheat but it sprouts barley instead in a dream, it means ostentatiousness. If it grows blood in the dream, it means that he profits from usury. Eating green wheat in the fields from its spikes in a dream means gaining spiritual progress through ascetic detachment. Eating cooked wheat in a dream means afflictions. Holding a bundle of ears of wheat, or placing them inside a pot in a dream means profits equal to the number of spikes one has gathered. Harvesting wheat outside the season in a dream means death, destruction, deception and trials for the people of that locality. Harvesting green spikes of wheat in the dream means the death of a young person, but if they are yellow and dry, then they mean the death of an elderly person. Bartering wheat for barley in a dream means replacing the Qur’anic recital with interest in poetry. Seeing wheat over one’s bed in a dream represents one’s wife. Planting its seeds in a dream means conceiving a child. In a dream, wheat also represents a cautious person who manages his affairs with wisdom and who spends his money to help people without being a spendthrift.";
