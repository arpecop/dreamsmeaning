var content = "For a lover, this is sometimes of contrary significance. Dreaming that he fails in his suit, signifies that he only needs more masterfulness and energy in his daring, as he has already the love and esteem of his sweetheart. (Contrary dreams are those in which the dreamer suffers fear, and not injury.) For a young woman dreaming that her life is going to be a failure, denotes that she is not applying her opportunities to good advantage. For a business man dreaming that he has made a failure, forebodes loss and bad management, which should be corrected, or failure threatens to materialize in earnest. ";
