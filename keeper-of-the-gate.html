var content = "(Personal guard | Prison guard) If a notable or a public figure sees his keepers of the gates, or his personal guards standing-up in a dream, it means that they are performing their duty correctly. If they are sitting in the dream, it means that they are failing their duties. The governor’s keeper of the gate in a dream represents glad tidings. Usually he represents a notable person, or a great person who is sought for advice, whereby both great and little people depend on him for access. The keeper of the gate in a dream also represents abeyance, or blocking one’s access. (Also see Doorman)";
