var content = "(Early companions | Legist | Masjid | Men of knowledge | Mosque | Reli- gious doctors | Righteous men) A scholar in a dream represents glad tidings, a promotion, or a commendation and it represents one who acts upon what he knows and says. Seeing one of the early scholars in a dream means increase in one’s knowledge, for they were the wise representatives of God’s message on earth. Seeing them also means increase in one’s wisdom, happiness, joy, and one’s dream could mean that one will stand to admonish people or counsel them. Seeing the early righteous people and the blessed companions of God’s Prophet, upon whom be peace, in a dream means growth of one’s righteousness. If one sees a scholar who is considered to be a reference in religious knowledge, and if one accepts his admonition in the dream, though in wakefulness he does not follow this school of thought, it means that he will be tried with an adversity that will be remembered by people for sometime to come, though his testimony will be accepted by the people. If a well-known early scholar appears in one’s dream when the dwellers of that locality are experiencing adversities, economic distress or a drought, it means that their calamity will be lifted. Seeing an unknown scholar, or an unknown religious doctor in a dream means that a physician or a philosopher may visit one’s house.
