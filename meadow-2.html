var content = "(Beauty | Grass | Green | Knowledge | Paradise | Wisdom) In a dream, a meadow represents an easy and a trouble free money, or it could represent a wife who has little reservation and tactfulness. Seeing a meadow in a dream also means receiving inner knowledge that is imparted directly by God Almighty through mystical inspirations, or it could mean establishing a charitable endowment. A meadow with its pasture, streams, perennials and spireas in a dream represents the world, its ornaments, attractions and wealth. A meadow in a dream also may mean a place of business or a work place. To see and cherish a green meadow without being able to unfold its reach in a dream represents the vastness and essence of Islam. If a poor person sees himself walking through the meadows, gathering grass, leaves, herbs, flowers and eating them in his dream, it means prosperity. If a rich person sees that in his dream, it means that his wealth will increase. If someone who has renounced the pleasures of this world or an ascetic sees such a dream, it means that he will return to desiring it, or that he will be seduced by the world again. Walking between meadows in a dream means going on a business trip or changing one’s profession. The same interpretation is given if one sees himself walking between two different markets. If one sees a deceased person sitting in the meadows in a dream, it means that he is in paradise. Meadows in a dream also represent the world and its pleasures, or they could represent a rich wife. Seeing an unusual meadow which is admired only when beheld, and enjoyed especially when visited in a dream represents a revered place, a house of God, a mosque, the grave of a prophet, or the graves of the righteous ones. A meadow in a dream also may represent the Book of revelations, the Qur’an, knowledge, wisdom, or paradise. If one sees himself walking from the midst of meadows into a salt swampland or a marsh in a dream, it means that he follows innovations, or that he indulges in sinful actions. Hearing the call to prayers from inside a meadow in a dream means a good deed, guidance after heedlessness, repentance, attending the congregational prayers, or following a funeral proces- sion.";
