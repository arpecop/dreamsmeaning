var content = "(Clothing | Food | Words) If a rich person sees himself either wearing coarse clothing, eating coarse food or speaking harsh words in a dream, it means that he will experience severe changes in his life and that will perhaps affect much of his savings. Should one feel more comfortable about such changes in the dream, or if he prefers them over his usual comforts, it becomes a sign of his humility, contentment, gratitude and the correctness of his way of thinking. Should he feel uncomfortable about such changes in the dream, it means that he will become subject to God’s wrath. Exchanging coarse words in a dream means aversion between people who actually love one another.";
