var content = "Dreaming that you are eating ice cream, foretells you will have happy success in affairs already undertaken. To see children eating it, denotes prosperity and happiness will attend you most favorably. For a young woman to upset her ice cream in the presence of her lover or friend, denotes she will be flirted with because of her unkindness to others. To see sour ice cream, denotes some unexpected trouble will interfere with your pleasures. If it is melted, your anticipated pleasure will reach stagnation before it is realized. i saw myself sharing one ice cream on a normal stick with a guy i used to be in love with many years ago. It was melting so both of us were passing the ice cream fast to each other without looking at each other before the ice cream starts to melt down. what could that mean? does anyone know…";
