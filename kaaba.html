var content = "(God’s house in Mecca.) In a dream, the holy Ka’aba represents the calif of all Muslims, his chief minister, a leader of a country, or it may represent a wedding. Seeing the holy Ka’aba in a dream also means that one may enter it, or it could mean receiving glad tidings and dispelling evil. Praying inside the holy Ka’aba in a dream means enjoying the guardianship and protection of someone in authority, and safety from one’s enemy. Entering inside the holy Ka’aba in a dream means entering before a ruler. Taking something from inside the holy Ka’aba in a dream means receiving something from the ruler. If one of the walls of the holy Ka’aba crumbles in a dream, it means the death of the Calif or the local governor. Entering the holy Ka’aba and failing to perform any of the prescribed rites in a dream means standing before God Almighty on the Day of Judgment having performed one’s obligations, or it could mean repenting from one’s sins. To look at the holy Ka’aba in a dream means safety and protection against fear. If one is given a job in Mecca in a dream, it means that he may become an Imam. Stealing anything from the holy Ka’aba in a dream means committing a sin. Walking toward the holy Ka’aba, or seeking it in a dream means correcting one’s religious standing. Seeing oneself in Mecca mixing with departed souls who are inquiring from him about the world in a dream means to die testifying to the Oneness of God Almighty and to the prophethood of His Messenger, upon whom be peace. Seeing the Ka’aba inside one’s own house in a dream means that one is still in power and living with grace. If the holy Ka’aba does not look right in one’s eyes in the dream, then it means adversities. If one sees the holy Ka’aba as his own house in a dream, the holy Ka’aba then represents the Imam of all Muslims who is the representative and vice-regent of God’s Messenger (uwbp), and it means that one truly follows the Imam. Praying on top of the holy Ka’aba in a dream means becoming an apostate. Entering the holy Mosque in Mecca and praying on the roof of the holy Ka’aba in a dream represents peace, tranquility, presiding over others, it also means that one will become victorious wherever one goes, though with a questionable conduct, he also may follow innovation and depart from the traditions and teachings of God’s Messenger, upon whom be peace. Walking by the holy Ka’aba, or leaving it behind in a dream means going against the traditions of God’s Prophet, upon whom be peace, following the path of innovation, or interpreting things according to one’s own mind and liking. If one sees angels descending from the heavens to lift away the pillar of God’s House from Mecca and place it in a different town in the dream, it means that people have gone astray and the time of destruction has come. It also means that the pillar of the faith, the righteous guide of the believers and God’s vice-regent on earth Al-Mahdi will soon emerge to dwell in that town. If one sees the holy Ka’aba burning in a dream, it means that one has neglected or abandoned his prescribed prayers. Any changes, decrease or increase in the shape of the holy Ka’aba, moving of it away from its place, or changing its look in a dream will reflect upon the Imam, or the guide of all Muslims. Circumambulating the holy Ka’aba or performing any of the prescribed rites in a dream means walking the path of righteousness, or correcting one’s religious life as much as one does in his dream. Failure to perform some of the prescribed rites that are associated with being at the holy Ka’aba in a dream indicates one’s deviation from God’s path, and such innovation is equal to changing the direction (arb. Qiblah) of one’s prayers. The holy Ka’aba in a dream also represents one’s prayers, for it is the focal point of all praying Muslims. The holy Ka’aba in a dream also represents God’s House, a mosque, a community center of all Muslims, and it represents a teacher, a guide, Islam, the holy Qur’an, the prophetic traditions, one’s son, a religious scholar, a shaikh, a master, a husband, one’s mother, and the heavenly paradise. The holy Ka’aba is God’s House, and thereat people will be gathered and led into paradise. The holy Ka’aba in a dream also represents the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, the gathering of believers, the local markets and the vicinity of the holy Mosque. If one sees that his own house has become the Ka’aba and people are seeking it and crowds are gathering at his door in a dream, it means that he will be endowed with wisdom, gain knowledge and act upon it, and that people will learn at his hand and follow his example. Performing some of the required rites at the holy Ka’aba in a dream also means that one may work for someone in authority, or serve a man of knowledge, a shaikh, a renunciate, one’s father, one’s mother, or it could mean that one has a master who demands clarity, true following and hard-work from his students and disciples.
