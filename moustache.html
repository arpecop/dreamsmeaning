var content = "Shaving, clipping or adjusting one’s moustache in a dream means lessening one’s burdens. A moustache in a dream also means money. A bad cut in one’s moustache in a dream means a mishap or losing money. Having an unusually long moustache in a dream means going against the currents, or it could mean an illness that will deprive one from eating solid food, or it could mean religious innovation. A long and an ugly looking moustache in a dream means difficulties, sorrows, distress, becoming an alcoholic, refusing to surrender to others what belongs to them, or refusing to pay charity, or pretending to ignore the necessity to pay the obligatory alms tax. Shaving one’s moustache in a dream for someone who follows that trend means comfort and dispelling sorrows. If one dislikes to shave his moustache and sees himself shaving it in a dream, it means that he will lose his rank, earn a bad reputation, or it could mean poverty or business losses. Having a small moustache or a short one in a dream means languor or laziness.";
