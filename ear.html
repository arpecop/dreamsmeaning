var content = "(Awareness | Deafness | Hearing | Stability) One’s ear in a dream represents his hearing, the point of his awareness, his rank, child, property or his status. The ear in a dream also represents knowledge, reason, religion, extent of one’s wealth, or pride about one’s lineage. If one’s hearing becomes clearer or increases in sensibility, or if he sees light beaming from his ears or driving into them in a dream, this dream will represent his guidance, obedience to his Lord and consent to His command. If he sees his ears looking smaller or producing an offensive odor in a dream, it means that he may go astray and indulge in actions that will incur God’s displeasure. If one discovers that he has an extra ear in a dream, it means a permission is given to him to fulfill what he intends. The number of ears one sees in a dream also represent the different arts and sciences, but they could also mean that the person in question has no stability. In a dream, one’s ear may represent the jewelry a woman attaches to herself as ornaments. To clog one’s ears with one’s own fingers in a dream means death in a repugnant state of innovation. Plugging one’s own ears in a dream also means ignoring a repulsive thought. Plugging one’s ears in a dream also could mean becoming an advisor to someone or a caller to prayers in a mosque, i.e., a muezzin. If one’s ears are transformed into an animal’s ears in a dream, it means losing respect or developing inertness or apathy. As one’s awareness, one’s ear in a dream represents a pouch, a wallet, a coffer or a safe. Ears in a dream are also interpreted to mean separation from one’s wife or daughter. If only half of one’s ear is there in the dream, it means the death of his wife. If one finds himself deaf in his dream, it means that he may lose his faith. Having large ears in a dream means shunning or avoiding what is true. If one sees as though his ears have eyes in the dream, it means that he may lose his sight. If one sees himself eating the accumulated wax of his ears in the dream, it means that he is a child molester. If one sees grass growing all over him but does not cover his ears or eyes in the dream, it means prosperity. (Also see Body 1 | Earwax)";
