var content = "If you dream of seeing growing apples on the tree, it symbolizes intelligence and good wealth. If you see yourself eating an apple in your dream, it signifies productivity, concord and enjoyment. Make sure you look after your health as well, as apples represents healthy life. The other meaning of seeing apples might symbolize your sexual behavior, as the apple is connected to the Garden of Eden. When you dream of seeing specifically green apples, it represents the love. Maybe you will be blessed to meet someone special in your life. To see putrid apples in your dream, means that the things you are hoping for will not be achieved the way you thought they will be achieved or it could represent imprudence.";
