var content = "(Discharge | Menstruation | The Curse of Eve) Experiencing one’s menstrual period in a dream means that one has committed a wrongdoing, or it could mean confusion. If a woman sees herself taking a ritual ablution thereafter in the dream, it means that she will repent for his sin and her adversities will be dispelled. If an aged woman sees herself experiencing that in the dream, it means that she will bear a son. If a widow or an unmarried woman experiences her menstrual period in a dream, it means that she will get married. If a man sees himself experiencing women’s menstrual period in a dream, it means that he will commit an unlawful act, or that he lies. If he sees his wife in her period in the dream, it means that she will close herself to him, or that he will lose money in his business. (Also see Garden | Hilarity | Mirth)";
