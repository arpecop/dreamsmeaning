var content = "In a dream, an earthquake represents fear of a higher authority. An earthquake in a dream is also interpreted to indicate major changes in that particular place, or a calamity that will befall a town or a country. If one sees the mountains rumbling, shaking and crumbling, then being restored to their original state in a dream, it means that a great happening will devastate such a place. If one sees the earth shaking or caving in, and if everything sinks into the ground, hitting a segment of the community and sparing another segment of it in the dream, it means that a calamity will befall that place, and it will manifest through social disorder, injustices or a plague. If one sees the earth shaking and the firmament rent asunder in a dream, it means that major adversities will hit their properties, cattle, farms and institutions, etcetera, as a divine chastisement for people’s sins. If one sees the earth moving under his feet in a dream, then it represents one’s striving and pursuit of his business needs or livelihood. An earthquake in a dream also represents exposing secrets, hearing bad news, a general scare, public disturbances, the surfacing of new diseases. If one sees the walls crumbling and caving in a dream, it means his death. Seeing an earthquake in an arable land in a dream means fertility or a good harvest. An earthquake in a dream also may mean travels, dancing, abstraction of business or having an argument with one’s family. If the destruc- tion hits the buildings in urban areas in the dream, it means business growth for construction workers, contractors or related industries. Seeing an earthquake hitting a fruit farm in a dream means a good harvest. If the quake takes place during the month of May, it means a fierce battle, fights between people or public disorder. If one’s dream takes place during the month of June, then it means destruction of evil trades and their people. If the dream takes place during the daylight time, then it means appointment of people of knowledge to leading positions in the government. If one dreams of an earthquake during the month of July, it means that a great person will die in that place. If it takes place during the month of August, it means that an enemy will attack that country. If it takes place during the month of September in the dream, it means that a stranger will enter that town and subsequently, the town will be hit with a severe plague and sufferings. If it takes place during the month of October in one’s dream, then it represents a common illness, safety of pregnant women and lowering or stabilization of prices. If it takes place duringthe month of November in the dream, it means frequent miscarriages. If it takes place duringthe month of December in a dream, then it represents severe calamities, plagues and death, though no enemy threat is visible. If it takes place during the month January in one’s dream, then it means the death of young people. If it takes place during the month of February in the dream, then it means hunger and miscarriages. If it takes place during the month of March in the dream, then it means prosperity and a good harvest. If a pregnant woman sees an earthquake in her dream, it means that she is delivering her baby.
