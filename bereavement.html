var content = "Dreaming of bereavement shows your hidden negative and sad thoughts. As we know bereavement is caused by huge loss of someone you love or cared a lot about that person. It is a very unpleasant emotion that leads to depression and apathy. Maybe the reason you dream about bereavement is a consequence of your lost to something you really liked to do, or you are not in contact with some person anymore, but you wish you were or any other reason of feeling pity for yourself. The worst thing of feeling bad and sad is to keep those feelings to your-self and do not let them out. Make sure you find the way to get rid of this state of your mind. ";
