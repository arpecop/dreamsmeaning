var content = "(Delivering water) In a dream, a water carrier represents a man of piety and trueness, because he practices the best of deeds and particularly if he does not receive a wage for his delivery in the dream. If one sees himself filling a bottle of water and delivering it to a house, it represents his earnings. A water carrier in a dream also represents a gnostic who heals the illness of people’s hearts with his knowledge, love and wisdom. A water carrier in a dream also represents one who can go near high ranking people. He also represents one who delivers people’s belongings to their hands. A water carrier in a dream also may denote evil, burdens, fights, dancing, or whirling. If a water carrier delivers someone a glass of water in a dream and receives money for it, it represents a responsibility or a burden he will carry, or perhaps that the other person may receive accumulated profits from his business.";
