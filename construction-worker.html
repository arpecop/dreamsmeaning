var content = "(Carpenter | Mason | Woodworker | Workman) Seeing a construction worker in a dream means both poverty or richness, or he could denote travels or uncertainty about what profession one should get into to earn his livelihood, or he could represent someone who patiently carries someone else’s burdens, or someone who fabricates a story, or someone who embellishes a story with lies, or someone who mixes the lawful with the unlawful. A construction worker in a dream also represents someone who stirs-up people against one another for a price. If some dust falls over him during his work in the dream, it means that he will benefit accordingly, and if no dust falls over him duringhis work in the dream, it means that he will get nothing from inciting people against one another. If one sees a construction worker demolishing a wall or a house in a dream, it means that some enmity will grow between friends that could bring about the death of one of them. (Also see Carpenter | Digging | Labor | Pickax)";
