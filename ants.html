var content = "If you dream of seeing ants, it signifies your unhappiness with something that you are dealing every day. Maybe it is a lifestyle you are having and hating it. You feel like no one understands you and do not want to communicate with you the way you do. There are so many things you are not satisfied with, that it makes your every day life like living hell. The other meaning of this dream could represent hard work and adapting time you will have to reach the goals you are trying to achieve. Ants could also symbolize the control you are suffering from. Maybe there are some circumstances, that makes you feel uncomfortable and controlled. The other meaning could be, that all big things in life happens from small things, so keep that in mind as well.";
