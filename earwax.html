var content = "(Auditory meatus | Cerumen) If one sees himself cleaning the yellowish waxlike secretion found in the canal of his external ear, or if he is cleaning it from someone else’s ears in a dream, it means that he will acquire a needed antidote or poison or become free from the plot of envious people. If one cleanse his ears from earwax or from other dirt in a dream, it means that he will hear good and pleasing news. If one sees himself eating the earwax he extracts from his own ears in a dream, it means that he is a child molester. Cleaning the wax of one’s ears in a dream also means hearing pleasing news.
