var content = "(Dismay | Fright | Terror) In a dream, fear means the opposite. In fact, fear in a dream represents peacefulness and repentance in wakefulness. If one sees himself scared and running away from fear in a dream, it means that he will win the upper hand. If one sees himself in a dream waiting to battle with fear, it means that he will join a war. If one sees himself afraid, and if a voice says to him – “Do not be afraid, you will not die, nor will you be able to bear this life,” it means that he may become blind. If one sees himself as a God-fearing person in a dream, it means that his worldly fears will dissipate and he will develop true devotion and constant remembrance of his Lord. The person or object causing fear in the dream represents harm and aversion. To feel scared in a dream means happiness in wakefulness. Fear in a dream also could mean evil, corruption or suffering from the consequences of wrongdoing one has committed. If one dies of fear in his dream, it means that he does not pay people their rights and particularly if he is afraid of a human being or from his own evildoing.
