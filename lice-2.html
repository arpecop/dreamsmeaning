var content = "Lice in a dream mean worldly success and prosperity. If one finds lice in his shirt in a dream, they mean receiving an endowment, or renewal of a leadership position. In a dream, lice in one’s shirt also may represent something one does not care for it to last. If one’s shirt is made of a rag, or if it is tattered in the dream, it means indebtedness. Lice on the floor in a dream represent weak people. If they surround the person in his dream, it mean that he mixes with such people. If he hates them in the dream, then they represent his enemies, though they cannot cause him any harm. If they bite him in the dream, then they represent people who slander him. If a louse flies away from one’s chest in a dream, it means that one’s son or an employee has run away from his house or place of business. If a large louse comes out of one’s skin in a dream, it means losing one’s life. A louse in a dream also represents a woman, a housekeeper, a son, an illness, an invading army, soldiers, depression, or distress. For a ruler or a policeman, lice represent his helpers. As for a teacher, lice in a dream represent his students, and for merchants, they represent his envious competition, while for a craftsperson or tradesmen they mean taxes. As for sick people, lice in a dream represent what seems to be a lasting illness. Cutting a louse in half in a dream means being good toward one’s children. Eating a louse in a dream means backbiting someone. A colony of lice in a dream represent punishment. Lice in a dream also represent one’s dependents or relatives who backbite, slander and divide the family. An invasion of lice in a dream means blessings, wealth, relief from difficulties, dispelling all worries and sorrows. Killinga louse in a dream means the same in wakefulness. If one wakes up from a dream in which lice were attacking him, it means that he will not escape from depression, difficulties or adversities. Picking up a louse from one’s shirt or garment in a dream means hearing lies. If one becomes allergic to lice and starts itching in a dream, it means debts. Plant lice in a dream represent wrath, a calamity or a punishment. (Also see Nit)";
