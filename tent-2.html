var content = "(Canopy | Pavilion) In a dream, a tent means travels, a grave, a wife or a house. A camp of tents in a dream represents clouds. If a tent is raised over someone, and if he is a merchant, it means that his business will grow. If he is a soldier, it means that he will rise in rank. If he is unwed, it means that he will get married. If one sees a white tent raised beside his tent in a dream, it represents a righteous person who commands what is good and forbids what is evil. It also means that he will repent for a hideous sin. If one sees the moon inside his tent in a dream, it means that he will illicit sexual intercourse with a boy or with a young girl from a noble family. Seeing unknown white or green tents in a valley represent the graves of martyrs. (Also see Canopy | Pavilion)";
