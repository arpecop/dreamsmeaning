var content = "Thunderbolts in a dream are signs of punishment, illness or death. If a thunderbolt hits and burns something in the dream, it means false rumors, damages, financial losses, recession, or dumping of merchandise. A thunderbolt in a dream also means a warning for a sinner, the punishment for his crime, devastation, calamities, diseases, tornados, plagues, a blast, a major political shift, tyranny, decapitation, a bad death, inceneration, burining people alive, or a robbery. If one is under surveillance, then seeing a thunderbolt in a dream means a crackdown on his house or business. If thunderbolts strike people’s homes in a dream, they mean the arrival of covetous and despicable criminals in the company of decent and innocent people who are not aware of the true identity of their companions. If thunderbolts strike the fields and damage the crop in a dream, they represent taxes or an investigation. If one sees a town hit and burnt with a thunderbolt in a dream, it means that an unjust governor will rise in that town, and his government will bring fear, rising prices, economic chaos, injustice or war. If a thunderbolt does not carry fire in the dream, then it represents a new leader. (Also see Earthquake)my dream was a little different wasn’t a description that fit, what I saw in my dream, what happen was it seem to be a normal day, I was in a backyard of a huge house, on the phone with my bestfriend my lady was in it &amp; up ahead it was a massive light from a far like it looked like massive energy coming from the sky &amp; lighting kept striking, sending waves of energy through the ground but it wasn’t harmful to anything but it was so massive, I was not fearful of it or it didn’t worry me or damage the huge house, when I saw the strike of tha lighting touch the surface of the ground, I simply jumped in the air &amp; before I landed tha wave of energy past";
