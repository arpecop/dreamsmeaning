var content = "(Calamity | Misfortune) A scorpion in a dream means distress, dismay and trouble caused by a chatterer or a backbiter. A scorpion in a dream also means that one may be deceived by someone with a scorpion quality, and particularly if he uses a short haircut around the ears in the dream. A scorpion in a dream also represents a backbiter and an enemy from within one’s family. If one catches a scorpion inside his own house and throws it at his wife in the dream, it means that he engages with a loathsome and a forbidden sexual relationship with her from the anus. If a scorpion attacks people in a dream, the scorpion there represents a homosexual. A yellow scorpion in a dream repre- sents a fierce enemy, though he would have more patience in getting at his prey. A yellow scorpion in a dream also means incoming money. Killing a yellow scorpion in a dream means making a good investment that will show profits. The sting of a scorpion in a dream represents the benefits one will receives and they will not remain long in one’s possession. If scorpions pierce through the walls of one’s house in a dream, it means the death of one’s enemy. A scorpion in one’s pants in a dream represents an enemy who blackmail or takes advantage of one’s wife. Eating a cooked or a broiled scorpion in a dream means making money behind the back of one’s enemy, or winning ajust inheritance case against one’s opponent. Eating an uncooked scorpion in a dream means backbiting a corrupt person. Eating a scorpion uncooked in a dream also means getting unlawful money. A scorpion coming out of one’s anus in a dream means begetting children who will turn enemies of their father. Swallowing a scorpion in a dream means letting an enemy inside one’s house. A scorpion inside one’s shirt or shop in a dream represents trouble and distress regarding one’s livelihood. A scorpion sitting on one’s bed in dream represents an inside enemy. A scorpions inside one’s stomach in a dream represents the enmity of one’s employees or children who work for their father. A scorpion in a dream also represents someone who speaks his mind and does not know his friend from his enemy. A scorpion in a dream also represents an enemy who lacks determination or will. Killing a scorpion in a dream means that one will capture and destroy his enemy. If one sees something that resembles a scorpion but is not a scorpion in a dream, it means that he has suspicion about someone who is not an enemy. The stingers of a scorpion in a dream represent one’s tongue. (Also see Sting)";
