var content = "A priest is an augury of ill, if seen in dreams. If he is in the pulpit, it denotes sickness and trouble for the dreamer. If a woman dreams that she is in love with a priest, it warns her of deceptions and an unscrupulous lover. If the priest makes love to her, she will be reproached for her love of gaiety and practical joking. To confess to a priest, denotes that you will be subjected to humiliation and sorrow. These dreams imply that you have done, or will do, something which will bring discomfort to yourself or relatives. The priest or preacher is your spiritual adviser, and any dream of his professional presence is a warning against your own imperfections. Seen in social circles, unless they rise before you as spectres, the same rules will apply as to other friends. See Preacher. ";
