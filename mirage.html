var content = "(Phantom | Spook) In a dream, a mirage represents falsehood, or some- thing that will not take effect. If one desires something, then sees a mirage in his dream, it means that his desire is impossible to attain, or that he will be deprived from attaining it. A mirage in a dream also represents hypocrisy and ingratitude, disbelief in God’s oneness and love to amass the world and to indulge in its pleasures. A mirage in a dream also may denote false hopes, or unattainable goals. If one is summoned by the court to testify in a case, and if he sees a mirage in his dream, it also means that he will give a false statement. A mirage in a dream also represents a story that has no basis, or deception and lies that are reported as if they were true. (Also see Ghost)";
