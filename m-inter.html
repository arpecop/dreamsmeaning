var content = "(Money) A minter in a dream represents a well spoken person who tricks others with his fancy words. If he does not receive a wage for his work, a minter in a dream represents a reliable and an honorable person of a pleasant character and company. However, if he asks for wage in the dream, then he represents a hypocrite, a slanderer, one who follows hearsay, or he could be a poet. Minting in a dream connotes an appointment at a high ranking position for a qualified person. A minter in a dream also represents the ruler, his chief minister, a religious leader, a spiritual person, an artist, a scribe, a tax collector or an employee of a collection agency. A minter in a dream also represents religious jurisprudence, or one who observes his religious rites. A minter in a dream also represents a srotyteller, a religious doctor, or a dream interpreter. Forging money in a dream means speaking bad words, or speaking words without acting upon them.";
