var content = "(Seeds | Terebinth | Tree) Pine trees and their fruit in a dream mean loneliness and bewilderment during travels. Climbing a pine tree in a dream means triumph, success and hearing good news. Pine nuts in a dream represent the pine tree itself. A pine nut in a dream also represents a renowned person who has a noble character, a godly person who is respected, holy but poor, or it could represent someone who has little to offer, or a person who shelters thieves out of compassion. The same interpretation applies to owls and crows. Building a door for one’s house from pine wood in a dream means hiring a servant or a doorman who has little politeness and who is filled with foolish ideas. If a merchant or a businessman builds such a door in a dream, it means that he will unknowingly employ a thief.";
