var content = "When you dream of a baby, it represents purity, chastity and
sincerity. Babies usualy represents the warmth and good intentions you might
have. Dreaming of a baby could also represent the side of you which is weak,
fragile and vulnerable. If you dreamed of having a baby, but forgot it as a
fact it symbolizes your fear of being recognized as fragile person. You don not
want others to know that you are not a strong person, because this is not
something you are proud of. If you see yourself on the way of having a baby it
means that you wish someone would take care of you as long as it is possible,
you like to be dependant on someone. You do not want to take responsibility of
anyone neither yourself, neither the others. If in reality you are already
expecting the baby, then this dream indicates your fear and worries of going to
labour. If you dream of a baby which is crying, it shows that you are seeking
for attention and understanding and support from the others. There is something
missing in your life and you do not feel completed as a person. If you see the
baby that is hungry it shows that you are lacking of taking responibility for
yourself. If you dream of very unusually small baby, it represents your
apprehension and misgiving of others knowing what you really are. If you dream
of a baby that is dead, it shows that part of you will never be the same as it
used to be before. If you dream of putting the baby in and out of the water it
shows the reversion you will get in. the Baby was drown and saved by someone in my dream.My husband had a dream where he was holding a very happy baby,he doesnt know who’s lol but just wondered if you knew the meaning to that please???None of this helps me with my dream of a baby covered in poop  (This doesn’t help. My dream was that i was going down in the basement and i saw one of those ahh what do u call them
They weren’t like tubes as in space style. Anyway, i saw my husband and he showed me what was inside in one was a healthy baby and in the other was a baby that was burnt. Well i went upstairs and after a while it started raining and then i stay telling for my husband and when i saw him i asked him where are the babies. He speed me the basement and our was flooded. I started freaking out then he dives in and i do to and i saved the burnt one and he saved the healthy one.. I cut the top of the tube and looked at the baby and i put my finger up and he grabbed. I fell in love with him. Then my husband’s friends came to get us and i look back down at the baby and he looked …. Not burnt. And he was squirming and i relaxed him. My Partner just had a dream about throwing up dead babies with the umbilical cords still attached to the throat, he felt like he was choking,  He was in an abortion clinic but didnt feel like he should be there and he was there because he was vomiting the babies up. In his dream, throwing up babies was the normal way to give Birth, What does this mean?  xI had a dream that i had a baby boy. I remember i was holding him In a mall where my sister worked at but not in real life though.i remember i looked down at him he was swaddled in a very light blue blanket. And i was trying to name him and the only  name. That came to my mind was Zachary idk where that name came from. It felt like someone was telling me inside my head just Zachary Zachary Zachary i told my sister the name and she loved it so ya  i named him Zachary. But when i was holding him i felt so much warmth and I loved him so much. Also i thought it was weird that i could actually see his face. But anyway can u please tell me what the name Zachary ment in my dream and tell me the meaning of my dream";
