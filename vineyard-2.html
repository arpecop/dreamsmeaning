var content = "(Espalier | Grapevine | Trellis | Woman) A vineyard in a dream represents honor and strength, and the same goes for all fruit trees. A vineyard in a dream is also interpreted to represent a wealthy woman. Cutting branches from a grapevine in a dream means receiving money from a noble woman. Thus, an espalier in a dream represents a generous woman. A grapevine in the wintertime in a dream represents a woman who has lost her wealth, though one still thinks that she is rich. Plucking a bunch of grapes from an espalier in a dream means spending one’s money on a woman. If one sees it but does not pluck any grapes from it in the dream, it means that he will be spared unnecessary expenses. A grapevine in a dream also represents marriage. A trellis for grapevines in a dream represents a beautiful, a noble and a rich woman. The same interpre- tation is given for the garden surrounding it. To see a close-up view of a vineyard with its clusters of grapes and leaves in a dream means gaining financial benefits from associating with a community of believers. (Also see Wine press)";
