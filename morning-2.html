var content = "In a dream, the morning represents the fulfillment of a promise, or it could mean an unavoidable happening. If one sees himself unhappy and miserable in the morning hours in a dream, it will denote a low spiritual state, lack of religious coherence, or it could mean sinfulness. If an honest person sees the morning in his dream, it could mean either glad tidings of a new born if he is generous, or loss of his wealth if he is stingy. If a farmer sees the morning in a dream, it means a penalty, a punishment, or financial losses for that year. If one loses something then finds it in the morning in his dream, it means that he will provide a proof that will inculpate his enemy. If a sick person sees the morning in his dream, it means either recovering from his illness, or it could mean his death. If one leads others in prayers in such a dream, it means travels, or making a pilgrimage to Mecca. If the dream is interpreted to be his death, then it means a good end to his life in this world, light in one’s grave, or that God willing, he will enter paradise. If one sees the morning and solicits water to drink, or purchases food, or barters for some barley in his dream, it means that he will overcome his difficulties and dispel his adversities. If a prisoner sees the morning in his dream, it means that he will be released shortly. If one’s travels are impeded by whatever cause, then seeing the morning in his dream means solving such problems and proceeding on with one’s plans. If one is having difficulties with his wife, then seeing the morning in a dream means divorce or separation. If a sinner sees the morning in his dream, it means repentance from his sin and egress from heedlessness. If a merchant or a businessman who is having trouble in his trade sees the morning in his dream, it means good news and business growth. In general, seeing the morning in a dream means relief from difficulties, escape from danger, a good harvest, or winning one’s freedom.";
