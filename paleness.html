var content = "(Yellow) Paleness of one’s face in a dream means a sickness. If one sees his face bright yellow in a dream, it means that he will be among the exalted and blessed people in the hereafter. However, paleness of the face in a dream also may be interpreted as humiliation, jealousy, or hypocrisy. Paleness of the face in a dream also could mean devotion, standing up in prayers at night, observing night vigils, being in love, piety, contemplation, or being afraid of something. If one sees his face white and his body yellow in a dream, it means that what he shows outwardly is better than what he hides. On the other hand, if one’s face is yellow and pale and his body is white in the dream, then it means that his heart is better than what others can perceive from his outer look. If both his face and body look pale and emaciated in a dream, it means an illness. Paleness of the face alone in a dream also means sadness or sorrow. Wearing a yellow garment in a dream means an illness, unless if it is made from silk. If one sees himself in a dream wearing a yellowish silk -brocaded cloak, it means religious fakery, or committing improprieties under the name of one’s religion. (Also see Yellow)";
