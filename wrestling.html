var content = "(Fight | Struggle) If one sees himself wrestled to the ground in a dream, it means that he may lose his wealth. However, the one who is wrestled to the ground in the dream will ultimately be victorious. The winner in the dream is the loser in wakefulness. If there is a witness during the fight, then it could mean that the winner in the dream may become the winner in wakefulness. This could also happen if the winner in the dream has better preparedness, or if he is fighting for his food, such as in a struggle between a beast and a human being. If one sees two friends fighting a wrestling match in a dream, the loser in the dream has better standing in wakefulness. Wrestling in a dream also could mean a sickness that may befall the loser, or it could denote the consequences of an illness. If one sees himself battling with a beast, and if he kills the beast in the dream, it means relief from difficulties and dispelling of his sorrows and sufferings. If one reaches the throes of death in his fight in the dream, it means that he will triumph over his enemies. (Also see Wrestling match)";
