var content = "If someone has dreamed of being blind, the main meaning for this dream tells that there is something that has been misunderstood. It seems that you do not understand the situation exactly how it is an&#x2F;or you have no idea how to deal with it. The dream shows you that you feel confused and lost and do not know which direction to turn, to make the right and good decision. The other meaning of this dream also explains that you trying to ignore something that is obvious. Try to be responsible for your actions and take the obligation for everything you supposed to do. This is a bit an eye opener situation, as it shows you that there are more opinions and ways than only yours. ";
