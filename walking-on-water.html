var content = "Walking on water in a dream represents one’s strong faith, certitude and trust in God Almighty. This is particularly true if while waking one also speaks words of wisdom. Otherwise, walking on water in a dream also could mean clarifying a complex issue. Walking on water in a dream also could mean undertaking a dangerous venture and trusting one’s affairs to God’s protection. If one walks back from the water to the dry land in a dream, it means that he will satisfy his needs or fulfill his intentions. In a dream, waking on water represents one’s good intention, clarity and certitude. Walking on water in a dream also means unveiling a mystery, the need to trust one’s affairs into God’s hand, or it may mean approaching a danger, or it could mean that the accumulated pressures one is enduring are bearing heavy on him. It also means placing one’s trust in God Almighty before embarking on a trip that could entail some danger. To walk on water, whether it is an ocean or a river in a dream also denotes good spiritual standing, religious assiduousness and strong faith, certitude and determination. (Also see River | Water)";
