var content = "(Grilled meat | Restaurant) To buy roasted or grilled meat from a restaurant in a dream means enrolling one’s children in a school and entrusting them to a good teacher to educate them and properly train them. The owner of such a restaurant represents an educator, a trainer or a shaikh. Buying from him in a dream also means hiring a worker who is trained at the hands of an experienced master. If one sees himself roasting or grilling meat in a dream, it means that he may become a tax collector, a physician, a jailer, a torturer, a thief, or a murderer. Seeing someone roasting meat on fire in a dream may denote a wedding, a picnic, or celebrating the birth of a new child. If the meat is well-cooked in a dream, it means good news. Otherwise, if the meat is still uncooked in the dream, it means a headache and stress caused by one’s son. Roasting a whole sheep in a dream means money. Eating the meat of a roasted sheep in a dream means money earned through one’s son. Roasting a calf in a dream means appeasement of one’s fears, or news about one’s wife giving birth to a son, or it could mean standing in court before a judge. Eating anything that is touched by fire in a dream means profits. If one sees a roasted leg of sheep talking to him in a dream, it means that he will escape from an accident, a danger, or gain a strong foothold, or become well established in this world. A broiled rib in a dream represents a woman, for Eve was created from Adam’s rib. The chest represents plants and servants. The belly represents the children. A roasted leg in a dream represents woman’s earnings that her husband regularly swindles from her. If it is uncooked, then it means slander or backbiting. Eating roasted or boiled meat in a dream also could mean hard earned money, fears, sorrows, pain and sufferings, an illness, or persecution. Broiling a female sheep, or a ewe in a dream represents an illness that may befall one’s mother, wife or a relative. Broiling meat in a dream also means strength, marriage, health, wealth, the arrival of a traveller, love, unity, spying, telling on others, losing all benefits, squandering money, severing one’s relationship with his family, cutting one’s blood ties, or it cold denote a fever.
