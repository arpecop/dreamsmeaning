var content = "In a dream, a peacock represents a vain and a strutting person. A peacock in a dream also could represent a beautiful and a wealthy woman, or cheerful looking people. If one sees himself owning apeacock and a pigeon in a dream, it means that he is a pimp. A female peacock in a dream represents a bride, children, or wealth. Owning a peacock in a dream also means wandering, heedlessness, pride, ostentatiousness, backbiting, deceit, lies, confiding into one’s enemy, loss of blessings, experiencing poverty after being rich and tightness after plenitude. Seeing a peacock in a dream also means jewelry, clothing, presidency, a beautiful wife, marriage and good children. Eating the flesh of a peacock in a dream means the death of one’s wife and inheriting her wealth. To hold the radiant rain-bow colored plumules of a peacock in a dream means profits earned earned through a woman. To catch the chick of a peacock in a dream means profits through a son from that woman, or it could mean that one may beget a son. (Also see Chicken)";
