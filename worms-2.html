var content = "(An organism living on another | Children | Insects | Parasites | Silkworm) In a dream, worms represent daughters or children living under their father. The same goes for all worms, annelids, intestinal worms, or parasites that live on cadavers. Seeing tapeworms coming out of one’s backside in a dream represents one’s grandchildren. If one sees worms coming out of his mouth in a dream, it means that some members of his family are plotting against him, though he knows about it, and he will finally escape from their danger, but at his own expense. If one sees worms coming out of his stomach in a dream, it means that he will distance himself from evil companions. Consequently, he will regain honor and purity. Worms leaving one’s body in a dream mean overcoming distress, or paying alms tax. Worms in a dream also represent one’s enemies. A silkworm in a dream means a customer in one’s shop, or it could represent one’s profession. Silkworms in a dream usually mean financial benefits, though in some circles they represent illegal money, or guesswork. (Also see Earth- worm)I dreamed worms came out of my bellybutton. .!";
