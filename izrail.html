var content = "(The angle of death | Bone-breaker | Death | Longevity) The archangel of death. Seeing him in a dream means martyrdom if one is inspired by it. If one sees the archangel ‘Izrail angry with him in a dream, it means that one will die unrepented. If one sees ‘Izrail standing above him, or battling him in a dream, it means that he will recover from a severe illness. Seeing the archangel ‘Izrail in a dream also means longevity, or going through unavoidable circumstances, or experiencing extreme fear. If one sees himself being ‘Izrai’l in a dream, it means rising in status to govern and to oppress others, or he might become an executioner, or perhaps that some major events may take place at his hand. Kissing ‘Izrail in a dream means receiving an inheritance. Seeing ‘Izrail in a dream also means separations, death of sick people, losses, destruction, fire, bad news, forfeiture of properties, stagnation of the economy, losing one’s source of livelihood, imprisonment, breach of promise, forgetting one’s knowledge, ne- glecting one’s prayers, obstruction of charities, hindrance of alms distribution, negating the rights of others, retreating to one’s privacy, rising prices, bad crop, a tyrant ruler, glass blowing, or bankruptcy. As for one who loves to meet his Lord, seeing the archangel ‘Izrail in a dream means attainment of one’s goal, fulfillment of a promise, freedom from prison, good news and glad tidings. If an unknown or a common person approaches someone in the street and whispers something in his ear in confidence, the commoner here represents the angel of death. It is said that each human being will see the archangel ‘Izrail three times during his lifetime, and it is the third time that ‘Izrail, upon whom be peace, will";
