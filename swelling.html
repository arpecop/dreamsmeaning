var content = "Dreaming that you see yourself swollen, denotes that you will amass fortune, but your egotism will interfere with your enjoyment. To see others swollen, foretells that advancement will meet with envious obstructions. Swimming. Dreaming of swimming, is an augury of success if you find no discomfort in the act. If you feel yourself going down, much dissatisfaction will present itself to you. For a young woman Dreaming that she is swimming with a girl friend who is an artist in swimming, foretells that she will be loved for her charming disposition, and her little love affairs will be condoned by her friends. To swim under water, foretells struggles and anxieties. See Diving and Bathing. ";
