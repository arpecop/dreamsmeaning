var content = "(Flour | Moving around in a circle) In a dream, a miller represents a selfish person who is particularly interested in acquiring worldly gains and at what- ever price it may cost. If one sees an old man being a miller in a dream, the old man here represents his grandfather, or one’s bosom friend and consequently one will prosper and become extremely wealthy from his business. If the miller is a young and a strong man in the dream, then he represents a strong helper. A bakery miller in a dream means that one will attain his own goals through hard work. If one sees himself grinding a sufficient quantity of wheat for two, three, or four people in a dream, it means that he labors for his own need and can barely provide for his family. If the miller is a young man who has gray hair in the dream, then he represents both prosperity and strength. Seeing a miller in a dream also means adversities, fights, a spendthrift, usury, or a hard working guardian. Grinding other grains in a dream means dispelling distress and bitterness from one’s heart. (Also see Saffron)";
