var content = "(Capital punishment | Death | Decapitation) In a dream, beheading means freedom from slavery or dispelling sorrows and dismay, payment of one’s debts, or it could mean prospering. If one knows his assailant in the dream, it means receiving wealth at his hand. If one is sick, it means that he will recover from his illness, and if he is not sick, it means that he will attend a pilgrimage. If the assailant is a young boy, then it means comfort, joy and relief from his burdens through his own death. If a healthy person is beheaded in a dream, it means the end of his comfort or loss of his job or authority. If one sees the governor of the town beheading him in a dream, it means that God Almighty will save him from his sorrows and strengthen him in this life. If one sees a ruler beheading his subjects in a dream, it means that he will issue a decree of amnesty for all prisoners. If one is beheaded as a result of a judgment or by robbers in a dream, it means that either one of his parents or a child of his may die shortly. If a condemned person on death row sees himself beheaded in a dream, it means that he will be released from prison and his judgment will be rectified. If an investor or a money exchanger sees that, then it means loss of his capital investment. If a traveler is beheaded in a dream, it represents his safe return home. If rivals see that in a dream, it means loss of their fight. (Also see Cutting off)";
