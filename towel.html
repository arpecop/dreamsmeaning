var content = "(Apron | Serviette) A towel in a dream represents one’s servant, employee, housekeeper, or it could represent a pilgrimage to Mecca. In a dream, a towel also represents one’s wife, and for a woman it represents her husband. If a towel is used as a mat during sexual intercourse in a dream, then it represents a discrete servant who protects his mistress’s secrets, or it could represent money that serves woman’s needs and those of her children. To throw a towel at someone in a dream means to slam the door in his face, or it could mean separation between two people. To throw in the towel in a dream also means to give up one’s fight.";
