var content = "(Bathhouse | Rest room | Sauna | Steam room | Sweat room) Seeing the attendant of a public bath facility in a dream means paying one’s debts, dispelling one’s problems, ending one’s difficulties and washing oneself from sin. On the other hand, seeing him in a dream also could mean depression or a sickness. If one sees himself as the attendant of a Turkish bath facility or a bathhouse, and if he stood by and did not serve the customers in the dream, it means that he is a pimp and a bastard who brings benefits to no one but rather wrath. If one sees himself wearing a white uniform and serving people in a dream, it means that he washes people’s hearts and dispels their trouble. Public bath in itself denotes many meanings. (Also see Toilet)";
