var content = "(Inundation | Torrent) Flood in a dream represents enemy attack, harm, destruction, sickness, a toiling journey or the inundation of a town. If the water flows toward a river in a dream, it means that he will escape from a dangerous enemy. Fighting a flood or trying to prevent it from entering one’s house in a dream means fighting with one’s enemy to protect one’s family and property. However, if people still benefit from its waters for their wells or farms in the dream, then it represents a prosperous year and a good harvest, or it could represent good irrigations and strong dams. In a dream, a flood also represents lies, hypocrisy, wasting one’s speech, or it could mean falsehood. If one sees his town flooded with blood in a dream, then it represents God’s wrath and punishment for people’s sins. Inundations in a dream also could represent a rainfall, one’s tongue or a sharp spoken woman. If one’s house is flooded in a dream, it represent past deeds that will bring later benefits. Flood in a dream also represents liquid nourishment such as honey, milk, or oil. If one sees himself collecting the waters of a flood in jars and people seem happy about it in the dream, it means the availability of food products in abundance and falling or stabilization of prices. A flood in a dream also means blocking the roads to extremism or isolating a danger. When one sees a flood in his dream but outside of its season, it means that he is following some psychic influences or pursuing religious innovations. It also means wrath, destruction, impeachment, penal- ties or a plague, unless if it is falling from the skies, then it means rains and blessings. If one sees himself coming out of his home to swim into an inundated town in the dream, it means that he will escape from a ruthless tyrant. Should one fail to cross, and if he is rather forced to return to his house in the dream, it means that he should be careful about staying in that town or about disobeying his boss. Stopping the flood from reaching or entering one’s home in a dream also means reconciliation with one’s enemy.";
