var content = "(Educator | Eye-brow | Governess) Seeing one’s mother in a dream has a deeper and a stronger meaning than seeing one’s father. All the same in one’s dream, seeing her means attaining one’s goal. Man’s dreams are most pleasing when he sees his parents, grand parents or a relative. If one is going through difficulties and sees his mother in a dream, it means that help will come his way from sources he does not anticipate. If in real life he is awaiting someone’s return from a journey, that person could arrive shortly. If one is sick, it means that he will be cured from his illness. If one sees his mother giving birth to him, should he be ill in real life, then it means the approach of his death, for a deceased is wrapped in a shroud, while a new born is wrapped with a receiving cloth. If the person in question is poor, then seeing his mother in a dream means that his financial conditions will change for the better. If he is rich, it means restrictions of his earnings, for a child is dependent on others, and his movements are restricted. (Also see Earth)";
