var content = "(Avenue | Direction | Path | Trail | Way) A road in a dream represents the divine law. Seeing many roads in a dream denotes deviation from God’s path, or it could mean religious innovation. Walking on a side road, or yielding at a fork in a dream means going astray. If a highway robber attacks someone in a dream, it means that he will suffer from the loss of a friend. If one sees a ruler strolling through a rugged road in a dream, it means that he will establish justice and pave the way to righteousness and prosperity. A straight road in a dream represents God’s path, or it could represent one’s true faith in God’s revelations, or in following the practice of God’s Messenger, upon whom be peace, or following the guidance of one’s teacher or shaikh. Walking on a straight path in a dream means repenting from one’s sins and finding guidance. Seeing many roads in a dream means hesitancy, fluctuations in one’s faith, doubt, heedlessness, or apostasy. A road in a dream also represents a craft, eternity, the past, aging, continuity, the good example, or the bad example. A boat following the correct sea lane in a dream means salvation. A road in a dream also represents a woman, one’s livelihood, truth, or death. If a merchant sees himself walking on a road in a dream, it means that he will find new avenues to earn more money. A hidden road in a dream means pride, innovation and self- deception. (Also see Lane | Roadless terrain | Wending one’s way)";
