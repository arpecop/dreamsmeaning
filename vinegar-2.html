var content = "(Servant) In a dream, vinegar means money that is earned and spent in piety with blessings contained therein, or it could mean longevity, or wasting the least time possible in doing one’s work. Vinegar sediments in a dream represent ignoble or evil money that carries meager benefits, or which is deemed shoddy, In a dream, vinegar and its container represent a servant and her dwellings. Drinking vinegar in a dream means enmity with one’s household, or it could mean a family quarrel. As for a prisoner, drinking vinegar in a dream means his release from prison. Good vinegar in a dream means income and blessings, though when rarefied or stale, it means struggling to earn one’s livelihood. It also means toiling to make ends meet, or it could mean hardships. Vinegar in a dream also may mean marital problems, difficulties with one’s children, or a conflict at work. Vinegar in a dream also represents one’s bosom friend. To water one’s garden with vinegar in a dream means sleeping with one’s mother.";
