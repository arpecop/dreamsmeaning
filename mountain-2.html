var content = "A mountain in a dream represents a great and a noble man who possesses a strong and a commandingvoice, who commands good administration of his affairs and an excellent leadership. It also can be interpreted as a son, a difficult and austere woman, or a businessman. If the mountain is rounded or flat in the dream, it means difficulties or distress. A mountain in a dream also could mean achieving one’s goal, a journey, or fulfilling a promise. If the mountain is standing distinct from other mountains in the dream, the above meanings become stronger. If the mountain has pasture and stores a source of water, and if it is used as a permanent guarding post, then it represents a pious ruler. However, if it stores no water, and if no pasture grows therein in the dream, it represents a tyrant and a ruler who is an atheist, for in that case, it is dead and does not glorify God Almighty, nor can people benefit from it. In a dream, a mountain that stands high is alive, but a crumbling mountain which has turned into a pile of rocks is dead. If a person sees himself climbing an erect mountain, eating from its plants and drinking from its water, and if he qualifies to govern, it means that he will be appointed to a governing post under the auspices of a stringent ruler, though his subjects do receive benefits from his government. The size of benefits the governor will acquire is equal to the quantity of food and the measure of water he drinks from it in his dream. If the person is a merchant or a business man, a mountain in his dream represents profits and earning a good reputation. If climbing the mountain is easy, then there are no benefits in that climbing in the dream, for there are no benefits without hardships. If at the end of his climbing one thanks God Almighty for what he has reached in the dream, it means that he will become a just ruler. If he calls to prayers on the top of a mountain or performs his prayers thereat in the dream, it means that he will be appointed to govern. If one sees himself descending a mountain in a dream, it means loss of rank, business losses, or regret. If one is accompanied with his king and soldiers in a dream, it means that he is in the company of God Almighty and that of His angels, therefore, he shall be victorious, whereby, he can win a war, conquer an enemy, or renounces his attachment to the world. If climbing a mountain with difficulty means distress, then descending it in a dream means relief. If climbing means gaining a higher station, then descending in a dream means losing rank. If one sees himself climbing a mountain, though at a certain height he finds himself no longer able to climb or to descend in the dream, it means that he will die young. If one sees himself falling from a mountain in a dream, it means that he will fall into sin. If he falls and breaks a leg in the dream, it means that he will become despised by his superiors. A mountain on fire in a dream represents the death of a dangerous person. Leaning against a mountain in a dream represents friendship with someone in authority. Living in the shadow of a mountain in a dream means earning one’s livelihood from such a person and living happily there. Carrying a mountain in a dream means carrying the responsibility of managing the business of a notable merchant, and such responsibilities will bear heavy on him. If the mountain is radiant with lights, it means that one’s responsibilities will be light too. If he sees a mountain descending from the heavens in a dream, it represents a visit of the local governor to that locality. If one sees the mountain rising into the skies in a dream, it means that the governor of that town will be dismissed. Throwing stones from the top of a mountain in a dream means insulting others. If the mountain is beautifully dressed in the dream, it means that one will command a greater authority. Seeing a mountain at a distance in a dream means a journey. If one sees an earthquake hitting a mountain in a dream, it means that calamities will befall that land or country. If an evildoer sees a mountain in his dream, it means that he will surely suffer for his sins. Swallowing a mountain in a dream means commanding and controlling ruthless and strong men. Climbing a mountain until one reaches a flat surface in a dream means serving orphans, or nursing sick people. Entering a cave inside a mountain in a dream means reaching safety. The good or evil emanating from seeing a mountain in one’s dream depend on its fertility or bareness. Climbing a mountain and enjoying its vegetations and its sweet fresh waters in a dream means sheltering one’s chastity in the company of one’s wife, or learning a knowledge or a trade that will satisfy one’s needs. Climbing a mountain through a straight path in a dream means facing things the way they are. If one sees mountains moving forward with him, it means a war or a major conflict between people of knowledge. Falling down from the top of a mountain into the middle of beasts, crows, vultures, snakes, mammals, mire, filth, or rats and their different kinds in a dream means abstaining from sins, or refraining from innovation if escaping from them leads one into a mosque where he can enter to pray, or a garden where he can rest in peace. If the mountain crumbles, and if it is transformed into ashes or dirt in the dream, it means that whoever is meant in that dream shall lose his devotion and waste his life.
