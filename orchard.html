var content = "Dreaming of passing through leaving and blossoming orchards with your sweetheart, omens a delightful consummation of a long courtship. If the orchard is filled with ripening fruit, it denotes recompense for faithful service to those under masters, and full fruition of designs for the leaders of enterprises. Happy homes, with loyal husbands and obedient children, for wives. If you are in an orchard and see hogs eating the fallen fruit, it is a sign that you will lose property in trying to claim what are not really your own belongings. To gather the ripe fruit, is a happy omen of plenty to all classes. Orchards infested with blight, denotes a miserable existence, amid joy and wealth. To be caught in brambles, while passing through an orchard, warns you of a jealous rival, or, if married, a private but large row with your partner. If you dream of seeing a barren orchard, opportunities to rise to higher stations in life will be ignored. If you see one robbed of its verdure by seeming winter, it denotes that you have been careless of the future in the enjoyment of the present. To see a storm-swept orchard, brings an unwelcome guest, or duties. ";
