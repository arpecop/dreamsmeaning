var content = "(Calif | Caliphate | Deputy | Human being | Minister | Ruler | Secretary of state | Vizier) In a dream, a vice-regent represents someone whom people seek for his knowledge, or to learn the mastery of his craft, or he could represent an appointed justice of the peace. He also represents someone who inherits good and bad qualities, or whose character is different privately from the way he portrays himself in public. If one sees the vice-regent of the land in a stately appearance, or if he sees himself in such a form in a dream, it denotes his good state in this world and his success in the hereafter. Seeing him wearing an unsuitable garment in a dream reflects one’s own state, or it may mean that his current religious state is weak, though it may become better at a latter stage of his life. A vice-regent or a calif in a dream also represents someone who establishes the laws of his religion and follows the example of God’s Prophet, upon whom be peace. Whatever he is wearing in the dream connotes one’s own state, or the growing or diminishing of his devotion. If one who is promised something sees the vice-regent or the calif in his dream, it means that his promise will be fulfilled, and his wishes will come true. Seeing him in a dream also means that someone from a different circle is backbiting him, or speaking of him without his consent, or that people are reporting him to the authorities, or that scholars are discussing him, or mentioning his work. A vice-regent or a calif in a dream also represents aloofness, seclusion, truthfulness, volunteering one’s services, commanding what is good and forbidding what is evil, developing one’s own certitude and faith, repentance, abstaining from sinful actions, imprisonment, sickness, or travels. If one sees himself being awarded the seat of the vice-regent or calif in a dream, though he does not suit the position, it means that adversities and temptations will befall the land, though the people of knowledge and the righteous ones will escape such danger. It could also mean that he will suffer humiliation, and that the people whom he manages may rise to preside over him.";
