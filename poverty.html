var content = "(Beggar | Enamored | Emaciated | Hobo | Homeless | Indigence | Love | Men- dicant | Poor) Poverty in a dream means richness in wakefulness. Seeing oneself poor and hungry in a dream means that one will wake up to a great meal, or it could mean that he has stored sufficient provisions and satisfactory sustenance for sometime to come. If one sees himself as a poor beggar in a dream, it means that he prays incessantly and often asks God Almighty for extra favors and blessings. Seeing a group of needy people and beggars in a dream connotes the death of a rich person in that locality, and it is a sign for poor people to go and collect the charitable donations his heirs will distribute after his death. If someone sees himself asking for something, and if he is given what he is asking for in a dream, it means that he will receive money without trouble, or that he will earn easy money, for earning one’s livelihood with mere asking in a dream means a business without capital investment, or receiving without having to give anything in return. It is also said that if one sees himself as a poor person in a dream, it means that he will earn benefits in wakefulness. (Also see Beggar | Hobo)";
