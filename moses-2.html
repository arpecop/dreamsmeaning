var content = "(God’s prophet Moses, upon whom be peace.) If one sees God’s prophet Moses, upon whom be peace, in a dream, it means that God Almighty will destroy a tyrant at his hands. Following that, the person seeing the dream will rise in station, continue to attain one victory after another, and he will never be humiliated or defeated. Seeing Moses (uwbp) in a dream also denotes the strength of righteous people, and the inevitable defeat of iniquitous people. If at the time of seeing a dream with God’s prophet Moses (uwbp) there exist a tyrant or an ungodly leader, it means that God Almighty will destroy him, and one will be saved from his evil. If someone in authority becomes Moses (uwbp) in a dream, or if he wears one of his cloaks, it means that he will vanquish his enemy and fulfill what his heart desires. If one sees him (uwbp) in a prison or persecuted, or if one fears a major event that could put and end to his life, or an accident that could kill him, or a dangerous sea trip that could drown him, it means that God willing, he will escape and survive such adversity. Seeing Moses (uwbp) in a dream also means the end of tyranny, or victory in a war. If one is oppressed, worried and distressed by his own family, and if he sees Moses (uwbp) in a similar situation in a dream, it means that God Almighty will guide him to a way to overcome them, or if a traveller sees such a dream, it means that he will return safely to his home. Seeing Moses (uwbp) in a dream also indicates trials during one’s childhood, separation from one’s family, witnessing uncommon miracles, or that one may suffer from his own family because of an admonition, or it could represent a will he will leave to them, or it could mean commanding good and eschewing evil. Seeing Moses (uwbp) in a dream also means love for travel, praiseworthy intercession, sea travels, a safe return, profits, suffering from slander and false accusations, or perhaps it could mean that one may have weakness in his speech, or tottering, or that he may suffer from a head ill or injury. If someone who has renounced worldly pleasures, an ascetic, or a pious person sees Moses (uwbp) in a dream, it means increase in his wisdom, light in his heart and elevation of his station. If a woman sees Moses (uwbp) in a dream, she must fear loss of her child, or her dream could represent an adversity that should have a happy ending. If a child sees Moses (uwbp) in a dream, the same interpretation applies. If one sees himself carrying the staff of Moses (uwbp) in a dream, it means that he will reach a high rank and win victory over his enemy. If he is suffering from an evil spell or a sorcery, it means that it will be nullified. (Also see Orphan)I like the responses that Ive read but what if you hear crowd chanting Moses with a slight chauffeur trumpet in the background";
