var content = "(Castle | Child | Firmament | Heavens | House | Mother | Oath | Ocean | Prison | Teacher | Town | Wife | Wonders) In a dream, the sky represents itself. Whatever descends from it or comes from that direction in a dream will materialize. If fire falls from the sky over people’s homes in a dream, it means plagues, illness, pleurisy, smallpox, or death and destruction. If fire falls over the marketplace in the dream, it means higher prices. If it falls over the fields and farmlands in the dream, it means that the crops could either burn, freeze, or be struck by a swarm of locusts or by other harmful insects. If what falls from the sky indicates prosperity, such as honey, oil, figs, barley, or money, etcetera, in the dream, it means a good rain and a good harvest for that year. Whatever falls from the sky of good or bad may represent the government and the hardships it inflicts upon the people, or the benefits it may bring them. Climbing to the sky with a rope, a ladder, or using a staircase in a dream means exaltation, rising in station, good luck and support. If one climbs without a common medium in a dream, it means fear and arrogance. If his intention in climbing is to spy on others in the dream, it means that he may work as a spy. If one descends safely from the sky in the dream, it means that he will escape and be spared the consequences of his sin. If he falls and breaks or fractures a bone or so in the dream, it means that he may suffer such accident in wakefulness. If a sick person sees himself climbing to the sky, and if he does not return to earth in the dream, it means that he may die from his illness. If he comes back in the dream, it means that his illness will increase and his difficulties will reach their peak, though God willing, he will recover from his illness, unless he falls into a hole in a dream. In that case the hole represents his grave. If one sees the sky shooting arrows causing people wounds, injuries and bleeding in a dream, it means taxes and confiscation of properties by the government. If the arrows hit people’s ears and eyes only in the dream, it means that major trials and temptations will strike at everyone. If the arrows fall without causing harm to anyone, and if people rush to collect them in the dream, they represent a booty that people will come to win, or a divine gifts people will enjoy. To rise close to the sky in a dream means nearness to one’s Lord. This is particularly true for pious people and for true believers. Nearing the sky in a dream also represents a supplication needing an immediate answer, and God willing such prayers will be answered. Nearing the sky in a dream also could mean going before the governor of one’s town, or any person from whom one may need something, i.e., a teacher, a man of knowledge, a father, or a wife. If one sees the sky falling over his head in a dream, it means that the roof of his house may cave in, or that he will die from an illness he already suffers. If one sees himself climbing and entering the sky in a dream, it means that he will die as a martyr. If one sees himself standing in the sky in a dream, it means that he will command or admonish others. If one sees himself in the sky looking down at something on earth in a dream, it means that he will rise in station, then he will regret something he missed. If one sees the sky green in a dream, it means prosperity and a good harvest. If one sees the sky turned into iron in a dream, it means drought or scarcity of rain. If one falls from the sky in a dream, it means that he may abandon his faith, become a reprobate, or that he may be struck with a major calamity that will be driven by an unjust person. If the iron sky splits open, and if an old man appears from behind it in the dream, such an old person represents the grandfather of the people of that town or tribe. Consequently, people will enjoy a good harvest, prosperity and happiness. If it is a young man that appears in the dream, then he represents an enemy and an evil that may befall the people following such dream. If a sheep appears from the sky in a dream, then it means profits. If camels appear, then they represent rain. If a lion appears in the dream, it represents an unjust ruler. If the sky becomes one solid piece in the dream, it means drought. If it rips apart and its doors become wide open in the dream, then it means rain or an answer to people’s prayers. If one sees himself reaching out and touching the sky in a dream, it means that he is seeking an important goal, and that he will fail to attain it. If one sees himself rising near the lower heavens in a dream, it means worldly gains, or profits and status in either material or spiritual realms. If one looks toward the sky, whether to the East or to the West in a dream, it means travels. If one sees himself stealing the sky and hiding it in ajar in a dream, it means that he may steal a copy of the holy Qur’an and hides it with his wife. If one sees the sky wide open in a dream, it means blessings and benefits. If one sees himself rising toward the sky in a flat posture in a dream, it means that he will become emaciated, or suffer losses in his business. On the other hand, if one sees himself rising without difficulty and without being laid on his back in a dream, it means exaltation, success and safety from any harm that could be driven by one’s enemies. If one bites the sky in a dream, it means that a calamity will strike at him, or it could mean business losses, failure to attain one’s goals, or an argument with one’s superior at work. If one sees himself touring the sky then returning to earth in a dream, it means that he may become an astronomer, or an astrologer and gain fame in his field. If one sees himself leaning his back to the sky in a dream, it means that he may win a leadership position, or win victory over his opponents. If one sees himself in the sky having a form different than that of human beings in a dream, it means that he may leave this world unblessed. If one sees himself hanging down with a rope from the sky in a dream, it means that he will govern after someone else’s, or inherit his post. However, if the rope breaks in the dream, it means that he may lose such an opportunity. If one sees a lighted candle in the sky which luster and brightness dims the light of the sun in a dream, it represents a solar eclipse. If one sees the sky being build in his presence in a dream, it means that he lies in his testimonies. Falling from the sky in a dream also could be a warning against falling into sin. Falling from the sky in a dream with one’s head down means longevity. If one sees himself in the sky but could not remember when did he enter it in a dream, it means that God willing he is already in paradise. If one sees radiance, or scintillating rays of light coming through the sky in a dream, it means guidance. If he sees dark clouds coming through the sky in a dream, it means that he could stray from God’s path. If he sees a scourge descending from the sky in a dream, it means that plagues and adversities will befall the people as a chastisement for their sins, or for crimes they have committed. As for gnostics and people of knowledge, seeing the sky in a dream means clarity, vision, placing one’s interests in heavenly matters, or travelling to distant lands, or engaging in importing and exporting goods. Climbing into the sky in a dream also means falsehood, false beliefs, lies, or talking about God Almighty without the proper knowledge or guidance. Climbing into the sky in a dream also could mean seeking one’s livelihood, satisfying one’s needs, or fulfilling a promise. Skies in a dream also represent the ocean because of their vastness and the countless number of creation living therein, or they could represent the ripening of fruits, or the conclusion of one’s work, or they could represent one’s helmet, armor, wife, money, religion, death, or they could indicate slander and falsehood against someone who descends from them after being raised, and they could mean making peace with one’s enemies, or they could represent the shares allotted for each one of God’s creation, the good and the bad, people’s sustenance and that of beasts, gains, losses, blessings or afflictions.
