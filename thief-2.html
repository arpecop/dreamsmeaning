var content = "(Assassin | Illness | Robber) In a dream, a thief represents an illness, deficiency in one’s character, or a physical ailment. If the thief is a black man, it means that the illness relates to one’s black bile. If the color of his skin is red, then it relates to one’s blood. If the color of his skin is yellow, then it relates to his galls. If the color of his skin is white, then it relates to his chest and phlegm. Whatever a thief takes in the dream should be interpreted in relation to the substance of what he took. If he takes nothing from one’s house, then it denotes a passing ailment. If one catches the thief, or holds to his shirt in the dream, it means that he knows the cure. A thief in a dream also represents an assassin, the angel of death, a visitor, or someone asking for marriage. If there is a sick person in the house and a thief enters that house in a dream, it means the death of the ailing person. If a thief comes to one’s house and takes nothing from it in a dream, it means the recovery of sick person from his illness. A thief in a dream also can be interpreted to represent a cunning person, a deceiver, an adulterer, a hunter, a backbiter, someone who asks for things that do not belong to him, a lion, a snake, a Satan, eavesdropping, or one’s mind, desire and passions. If a scholar sees a thief in his dream, it means that he will learn wisdom from an anecdote. A thief in a dream also represents a liar, or the humiliation inflicted upon such a person.
