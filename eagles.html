To see young eagles in their eyrie, signifies your association with people of high standing, and that you will profit from wise counsel from them. You will in time come into a rich legacy. Dreaming that you kill an eagle, portends that no obstacles whatever would be allowed to stand before you and the utmost heights of your ambition. You will overcome your enemies and be possessed of untold wealth. Eating the flesh of one, denotes the possession of a powerful will that would not turn aside in ambitious struggles even for death.

To ride on an eagle’s back, denotes that you will make a long voyage into almost unexplored countries in your search for knowledge and wealth which you will eventually gain. ";
