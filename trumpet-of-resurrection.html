var content = "Hearing the sound of the trumpet of the Day of Res- urrection in a dream means hearing the truth. Blowing in the trumpet of the arc angel Israfil (uwbp) in a dream means salvation of the righteous ones. In a dream, the sound of this trumpet invokes fear incurring news that cause shivers and trembling in people’s hearts. If one hears it alone, then the news are exclusive for him. If everyone hears its sound in the dream, then it is a public affair. If one hears the sound of the trumpet and anticipates that everyone has heard it too in a dream, it means plagues and adversities, for the first blow indicates the end of the world and the death of everyone in it. The second blow indicates their resurrection back to life, which will be followed by the Grand Gathering for the Day of Judgment. If a sick person hears the first blow in a dream, it means that he will shortly recover from his illness. If the town is inflicted with a calamity, then hearing it in a dream means that people’s adversities will be lifted. If there is a drought, it will end and food prices will go back to normal. If one hears the second blow of the trumpet of resurrection in a dream, it means prosperity, revealing what is hidden, exposing long kept secrets, recovering from an illness, release from prison, reunion of beloveds, or meeting with people who have just arrived from a long journey.
