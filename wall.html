var content = "A wall in a dream represents knowledge, guidance, cognizance, knowing secrets, judgment, or separation between friend. Standing by a wall or sitting on it, and depending on its conditions in a dream represents one’s own state. A wall in a dream also represents a strong, wealthy, powerful and religious person. If the wall needed urgent repairs, and if a group of people come to rescue it in the dream, it represents a man of knowledge, or the Imam of a mosque who has lost his control or respect, then some friends will come to his rescue and to help him restore his rank. If a successful businessman sees the walls of his house collapsing in a dream, it means that he will recuperate a lost treasure. If one sees a wall caving over his head, or falling over other people in a dream, it means that he has committed many sins and unless his repents, his punishment will be swift. The caving-in of a wall toward the inside of a house in a dream means an illness, but if it falls toward the outside in the dream, it means death. Seeing a crack in the wall in a dream means that someone in the family will brace against him. Grabbing to a wall in a dream means the nearing of one’s death, pending how firmly one is grabbing to it in the dream. Grabbing to a wall in a dream is also interpreted as holding firmly to one’s interest in a strong person. If one builds a wall then tears it down in a dream, it means that he will attempt at destroying someone’s livelihood, or perhaps kill him. If one sees and recognizes a wall in his dream, it represents a close friend who may die from depression. A wall in a dream is also interpreted as a mighty person who cannot be managed except through kindness. Jumping over a wall in a dream means reverting from being a believer to a disbeliever, or accepting and following the advice of a disbeliever. Seeing one’s picture reflected in a wall in a dream means one’s death, and that his name will be itched on his gravestone. If a traveller sees himself returning to his house, whereby its walls are renewed, it means that he will get married. Seeping water from a crack in a wall in one’s dream means adversities and stress. (Also see Walls of the city)";
