var content = "(Meat) Human flesh in a dream represents one’s health, strength, earnings, sickness or one’s shop, piety, religious attendance, fear of wrongdoing, scruti- nizing the difference between the lawful and the unlawful, patience, forbear- ance, anger, distress, sexual desires, suffering from adversities and punishment for sins. If one’s flesh grows bigger than what one actually has in a dream, it means prosperity, and if one is sick, it means recovering from his illness. If one sees himself having less flesh than what he actually has in a dream, it means stagnation of his business or loss of his money and property. If a devoted worshiper sees growth in his physical fitness in a dream, it means slackening in his devotion and occupying himself more in material gains and worldly pleasures. If one sees himself emaciated in a dream, then it means the opposite. Buying a piece of human flesh in a dream means having a stagnant merchandise. If a judge or a ruler finds that his flesh has grown in a dream, it means that he will become famous for his verdicts, rulings or that he will become rich, or perhaps he might grow in fury or develop anger. Growth in one’s fitness in a dream also denotes happiness, joy and celebrations, while emaciation in a dream represents distress and adversities. If one sees his flesh black or blue, or if his skin is cracking in a dream, it denotes suffering from adversities, an illness or a punishment for his sins. Eating the growth of one’s own flesh in a dream means usury, or living on income from usury and saving one’s capital. Eating from one’s own flesh in a dream also means using one’s own capital, or doing something that will be followed by regret and sorrow. (Also see Meat)";
