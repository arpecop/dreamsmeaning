var content = "(Prophet David, upon whom be peace.) If one sees him in a dream, it means that he will gain power, authority, commit a sin, become an ascetic, be tried and oppressed by an unjust person, then he will be saved by God’s leave and regain the upper hand over his enemy. He will also receive an exalted office or rank of honor. It is also said, that if one sees the prophet David (uwbp) in a dream, that his country or town will be governed by a just ruler, an honorable president or a righteous judge. If in fact the ruler or the judge of that town, county or country is an unjust person, then seeing God’s prophet David (uwbp) in a dream means that God Almighty will surely replace him with a just and an honorable one. If one becomes God’s prophet David (uwbp), or if he wears his robe in the dream it means that he will be appointed as a judge, if he qualifies. If he does not qualify, it means that he will prosper, or that he will grow in piety and become righteous through much devotion, piety, sadness and crying in fear of his Lord and love for Him. Seeing the prophet David (uwbp) in a dream also means deputyship, trials with women, trouble caused by women, or it could mean recitation of the Qur’an or being in a state of constant remembrance of God Almighty, prayers, supererogatory prayers atnight, understanding the meaning of what one reads, repentance from sin, chanting songs of God’s love, returning to God’s path after heedlessness, manufacturing and processing minerals, or it could represent God’s acceptance of one’s repentance. Should one be in such a manufacturing or processing business, it means that great wealth will come to him, or that his adversities will be of little importance. Seeing the prophet David (uwbp) in a dream also means reaching a successful conclusion to one’s life in this world. If an unjust man of knowledge sees him frowning at him or warning him, then one must be at his guard, fear any wrongdoing and correct himself.";
