var content = "(Tongue | Speaking | Speech) Speaking the language of another people in a dream may represent their country or culture. Speaking Arabic in a dream means honor and dignity. Speaking Persian in a dream means associating with a higher class of people and benefiting from them in business. Speaking Hebrew in a dream means receiving an inheritance. Speaking Turkish in a dream means hearing pleasing words. Speaking Italian in a dram means eagerness to amass money. Speaking French in a dream means drawing benefits from one’s profession. Speaking English in a dream means love for the world. If one can speak in all tongues in a dream, it means that he will acquire wealth, strength and fame. (Also see Reading | Speaking)";
