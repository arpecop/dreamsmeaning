var content = "Dreaming of climbing to the top of a fence, denotes that success will crown your efforts. To fall from a fence, signifies that you will undertake a project for which you are incapable, and you will see your efforts come to naught. To be seated on a fence with others, and have it fall under you, denotes an accident in which some person will be badly injured. Dreaming that you climb through a fence, signifies that you will use means not altogether legitimate to reach your desires. To throw the fence down and walk into the other side, indicates that you will, by enterprise and energy, overcome the stubbornest barriers between you and success. To see stock jumping a fence, if into your enclosure, you will receive aid from unexpected sources | if out of your lot, loss in trade and other affairs may follow. Dreaming of building a fence, denotes that you are, by economy and industry, laying a foundation for future wealth. For a young woman, this dream denotes success in love affairs | or the reverse, if she dreams of the fence falling, or that she falls from it. ";
