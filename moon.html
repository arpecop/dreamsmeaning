var content = "Dreaming of seeing the moon with the aspect of the heavens remaining normal, prognosticates success in love and business affairs. A weird and uncanny moon, denotes unpropitious lovemaking, domestic infelicities and disappointing enterprises of a business character. The moon in eclipse, denotes that contagion will ravage your community. To see the new moon, denotes an increase in wealth and congenial partners in marriage. For a young woman Dreaming that she appeals to the moon to know her fate, denotes that she will soon be rewarded with marriage to the one of her choice. If she sees two moons, she will lose her lover by being mercenary. If she sees the moon grow dim, she will let the supreme happiness of her life slip for want of womanly tact. To see a blood red moon, indicates war and strife, and she will see her lover march away in defence of his country. ";
