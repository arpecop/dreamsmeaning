var content = "(Hidden treasure | Knowledge | Wheel) Discovering a treasure in a dream means acquiring knowledge. If one is a merchant, then it means profits from his business, or spending money generously on God’s path. If one is a ruler, it means expansion of his powers and it denotes his justice. Seeing a treasure in a dream is interpreted in relation to one’s type of trade. A treasure in a dream also represents a business. Discovering a hidden trunk with little money inside it in a dream means a short lived difficulty, but if the trunk is stashed with money, then it means distress, sadness and sorrow. In many instances, discov- ering a treasure in a dream may mean death, or it could mean becoming rich, or complying with a court order. Discovering a great treasure in a dream means martyrdom. Discovering a treasure and rejoicing in the dream means loss of one’s money or business. Discovering a treasure in a dream also could mean ease in one’s life, receiving an inheritance, distress, trouble, wearing a new garment, a wife, cheating on one’s taxes, or it could mean avoiding to pay alms tax, or hindering the distributions of charitable endowments. A treasure in a dream also represents a profitable business, or it could represent a money changer, a jeweler, or remembering something. Discovering a treasure that is difficult to reach in a dream represents a stingy person who hinders the distribution of charities, or if he is a scholar, it means that he does not like to share his knowledge with others, and if one is a judge, it means that he is unjust. If a woman discovers a treasure in her dream, it means that she is careful about spending money and managing her household. If the trunk has no cover or lid in the dream, then it means the opposite.";
