var content = "In a dream, each one of God’s prophets, upon all of them be peace and blessings, is like a compassionate father toward his son, who is trying to save his child from the hell of this world and the hell-fire in the hereafter. In a dream, a prophet also represents a teacher, a tutor, a shaikh, a warning, or glad tidings. If one sees them standing in a stately form, or if one prays behind them, or follows them on the road, or eats something from their delicious food, or drinks from their drink, or if one is anointed with their perfume, or learns something from them, or acquires a particular knowledge from them in a dream, it demonstrates his trueness, faith in God’s oneness, following His Messenger and being faithful to his traditions. Otherwise, if one walks before them, or leads them into a narrow lane, or stones them, or mocks them, or argues with them in a dream, it means that he is an innovator and a heedless person. This could also mean that he will be persecuted by his superiors, for a prophet in a dream also represents a ruler or a king, and God’s prophets are in truth the guardians of the souls, and they are kings in this world and in the hereafter. A prophet in a dream also represents a religious scholar, because religious scholars are the heirs of the prophets, upon all of them be peace. Religious scholars also know God’s prophets better than the common people. They understand their message and follow their traditions of glorifying God’s Oneness, devotion, piety, prayers, charity, acting upon what they know and admonishing others to follow the path of truth and righteousness. A prophet in a dream also represents one’s superior, a preacher, a righteous Imam, a conscientious teacher and a caller to God Almighty. Seeing any of God’s prophets looking gracious, stately and courtly in a dream also represents his people’s devotion, or that a major and a positive change will take place among his followers. If such a prophet looks spurious, unhappy in a dream, or if he appears in a state that does not befit God’s prophets, it means that his followers in the world have deviated from his path and created their own religion, opposing his commands, falsifying and interpreting his message to their own liking and abusing his admonition. If one claims to be a prophet in a dream, it means that he will become known in his field, or if he qualifies, he may become a ruler, a judge, a teacher or a caller to God Almighty, commanding what is good and forbidding what is evil. Otherwise, it means that he will be inflicted with a great calamity because of a falsehood he fosters, or innovations he practices. If one becomes a messenger in a dream or a caller to God Almighty, and if someone hearkens to him and accepts his message in the dream, it means that he will rise in rank. Otherwise, it means that he will become a broker, a liar, a defrauder, a swagger, depending on his level of knowledge, or it could mean that he will be struck with a major calamity in his life. Such a calamity will be of the same caliber, degree and nature that a messenger of God Almighty may have suffered from his own people. Seeing one of God’s prophets in a dream also means living the experience of time, space and condition in which he saw him in the dream. Wearing the cloak of one of God’s prophets in a dream means attaining one’s goals, or presiding over people, or acquiring true knowledge. Consequently, one will become renowned, revered and his opinions will be respected by most people. If one becomes a prophet in a dream, it means that he will die as a martyr, or become poor and be gifted with patience and endurance. He will then be granted victory, and God willing, all his needs will be satisfied. Emulating the devotion of a prophet in a dream means trueness in one’s faith, compliance with God’s religion, certitude and determination. Becoming one of God’s prophets, upon all of them be peace and blessings, in a dream means commanding good and forbidding evil, suffering from adversities and distress equal to those endured by such a prophet, then one will escape from destruction or humiliation by God’s leave and through His subtle kindness. If one sees a prophet suffering from poverty and asking for help in a dream, it means that God Almighty will satisfy all the needs of the person seeing such a dream for the sake of the blessings reserved for that prophet. If one kills a prophet in a dream, it means that he will betray a trust, negate a promise, or deny a covenant. Living in the time of one of God’s prophets on earth in a dream means honor, dignity, success, piety and wealth if one is suited for such gifts. Otherwise, it means that Satan is deceiving him. If a prophet of God Almighty beats a righteous and a sincere believer in a dream, it means that he will attain peace and salvation in his life in the hereafter. If a prophet talks to someone in a dream, it means that he will receive blessings, honor, status, knowledge, wisdom and fame in his life. (Also see Muhammad, upon whom be peace.)";
