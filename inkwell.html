var content = "In a dream, an inkwell represents honor, governing power, exaltation, wife, or money. An inkwell in a dream also represents marriage, business, or a servant. If one is presented with an inkwell in a dream, it represents a fight with a relatives or with a woman. If a respected witness is present when the inkwell is handed to the person seeing the dream, then it means a marriage to a relative. Licking an inkwell in a dream means engaging in sodomy or homosexuality. An inkwell in a dream also could mean that one may seduce his servant for an unlawful sexual intercourse and that she will no longer serve that house. To buy an inkwell in a dream means that one’s marriage will see no happiness since one’s writing pen comes out of it with ink only. An inkwell in a dream also means ulcer. The pen represents iron (See Iron), and the ink means time. If one sees a section of his body transformed into an inkwell, whereby he can draw ink from it and write in a notebook in the dream, it means that he will receive an inheritance. An inkwell in a dream also means medicine. If one is sick, then seeing an inkwell in a dream also means finding the right medicine and, God willing, one will be cured from his illness. (Also see Pederasty | Sodomy)";
