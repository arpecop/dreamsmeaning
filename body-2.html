var content = "(Dwellings | House | State) In a dream, the human body represents his state, and its strength represents his faith in God Almighty. If one sees himself wearing the skin of a snake in a dream, it means that he will avow his enmity toward others. If one sees himself as a ram in a dream, it means that he will beget a son from whose success he will earn his livelihood. If one sees his body turn into iron or clay in a dream, it means his death. If one’s body appears bigger in a dream, it means that he will prosper accordingly. Having a fat body in a dream means prosperity and knowledge, and an emaciated body in a dream represents poverty and ignorance. The body in a dream is what envelops and contains the human being. The body is like one’s wife, a garment, a house, one’s beloved, a child, a guardian, or a master. The health condition and strength of one’s body in a dream may denote any of the elements mentioned herein. (Also see Foot | Leg | Skin | Teeth | Tooth | Thigh)";
