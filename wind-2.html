var content = "(Blow | Changing course | Hurricane | Storm | Trap | Tornado | Wonder) In a dream, winds represent the person in authority or the leader. In that sense, winds in a dream represent the sphere of one’s control and his power to change things, or to maneuver people’s interests. Winds in a dream also may represent a leader, his army, commands and helpers. Wind was once one of the servants of God’s Prophet Solomon, upon whom be peace, as it moved under his command by God’s leave. A stormy wind in a dream may represent calamities, destruction, or plagues. A tornado in a dream means destruction or a calamity. On the other hand, wind in a dream may also mean pollination, good harvest, prosperity, victory, or success. However, winds in a dream also represent illness, rheu- matism, sneezing, aching, or headaches, etcetera. If one sees the wind carrying him and transporting him from one place to another with no fear on his part, and if there are no clouds or darkness in the skies in the dream, it means that he may preside over people, should he qualify for that, or if he wished to do so, or it could represent his business success, or that he will liquidate his merchandise, should it be stagnant or unsalable. If the winds lift someone who is seized by fear or tyranny, and if the winds carry with them dark clouds, or a cloud of dust in the dream, and if the person is travelling when he sees the dream, it means that he will face great difficulties. If he is ill, then his illness will intensify, or it could mean that some higher order will persecute him, or perhaps a judge will rule against him. If one sees a huge tornado or a tropical storm carrying people, trees, homes, or cattle in the air to scatter them over its path of destruction, then it represents a major plague, or a calamity affecting that region. Poisonous winds or polluted air in a dream represent a feverish illness. A stormy wind accompanied with thunder in a dream represents a tyrant. If the wind carries someone from one place to another in the dream, it means that he may travel there, but he may never return to his homeland. A gentle wind or a breeze in a dream represents grace and blessings for the people and the land. A storm of dust in a dream represents destruction in the land. However, winds in a dream always represent tidings from God Almighty. If the wind is not accompanied with a good witness or a cheering element in the dream, then it means cessation of blessings for that land. If the wind is accompanied with a stridulous or a shrill sound in the dream, it means a severe punishment for that place. If a general of an army sees himself leading his soldiers and is preceded by a stormy wind in a dream, it means that he will be victorious and that he will triumph over his enemy. However, if a storm faces him at his arrival to the battlefield in the dream, it means that he will lose his battle. If one sees a storm uprooting the trees in his dream, it means that the government of that land will mass murder its own people. A southern wind in a dream means illness, diseases, or death. A southern wind is sometimes interpreted as rain and prosperity. If one witnesses a slow moving wind in his dream, it means that he will consent to the actions of a group of evildoing people. If the wind blows from a known direction in the dream, it means mercy and blessings, or that one may receive good news from that direction. Winds in a dream also mean asking for one’s needs, or fulfilling them. A gentle breeze in a dream, represents travel and joy. If one sees the wind colored red in the dream, it represents a recalcitrant child. (Also see Fan)";
