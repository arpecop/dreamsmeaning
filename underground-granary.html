var content = "(Granary | Pantry | Storrage room | Subterranean storehouse) An underground grain storage house in a dream represents a caring mother, a single parent or a foster mother. This interpretation comes from the example of a fetus in his mother’s womb and its dependence on her to supply the necessary nourishment. Once the stored food is consumed, then it is necessary to depend on a new source. If one sees an underground granary demolished or filled with dirt in the dream, and if his mother is sick, it means that she may die from her illness. If one’s wife is pregnant, it means that she will soon deliver her infant. A demolished underground granary in a dream means finding a buyer for one’s grains, and the dirt that fills the storehouse in the dream represents money. If the stored grain turns into dirt in a dream, it means that market prices will come down, or it could mean the loss of one’s investment. Seeing a granary filled with food in a dream means that one’s wife is pregnant. If a fire consumes the stored grain in a dream, it means rising prices. If one sees a granary filled with sugar or dates in a dream, it means that prices will stabilize and become attainable, while the type of food stored therein will be in limited supplies and consequently, its price will rise. If a sick person falls into an underground granary in a dream, it means his death, or drowning in the sea, or facing a highway robbery. As for one who is engaged in a fight, an underground granary in his dream represents a prison or a visit to a brothel.";
