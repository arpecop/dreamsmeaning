var content = "(Employment | Knowledge | Prison) If a man of knowledge sees himself swimming in the ocean in a dream, it means that he will attain his goals. If he enters the water of the ocean then comes back to the shore in a dream, it means that he will commence his path of seeking knowledge then abandons it. Swimming in a dream also means going to jail. Swimming on sand in a dream means that one may be incarcerated, that his living conditions in his jail will be constricted, and that he will suffer in his prison from hardships equal to the difficulties he encounters during his swim in the dream. If one sees himself swimming inside his own house in a dream, it means that he will work for a ruthless, wicked and an unjust employer who will entrap him in his service through a business deal. Consequently, God Almighty will help him out of his entanglements. If one is afraid of swimming in the dream, it means that he is scared of someone in authority. If he runs away from swimming in a dream, it means that he will escape from him. If one sees himself entering waters where he can swim successfully in a dream, it means that he will engage in a major project, lead an important job, or acquire authority and power. If one swims on his back in a dream, it means that he will repent for a sin. If he swims in the sea and finds its water stagnant in the dream, it means that he will serve someone in authority, though his job will bring him nothing but trouble and the wrath of his employer. If he still manages to cross the sea in his dream, it means that he will escape from dangers his employment could inflict upon him. If he swims with fear in a dream, it means trouble, imprisonment, or a sickness he will endure depending on the type of needed efforts or distance he has to cross. Should he think in the dream that he will not be able to make it, then it means his death. If he shows courage during his swim in the dream, it means that he will be able to escape from such a dangerous job. Troubled waters in a dream mean adversities. Swimming successfully across troubled waters in a dream means overcoming one’s adversities. Any sea or agitated waters in a dream represent the authorities or the state, whether it be a swamp, a lake, a pond, a sea, or an ocean. If one sees himself drowning in a river, or a lake, then if he is carried by others and laid on dry land motionless like a fish in a dream, this also means trials and adversities. If one is saved from drowningbefore he wakes- up from his sleep in the dream, it means that he will triumph over his trials. Otherwise, if he dies from it in the dream, it means that he may die from such adversities. If during his swim one meets a ship that pulls him out of the waters, or to which he holds or grabs, it also means escape from adversities. If one drowns in the dream, it means that he may die as a martyr, though having previously indulged in many sins. To walk on water, whether it is the sea or a river in a dream means good spiritual standing, religious assiduousness and a strong faith and determination. Walking on water in a dream also could be interpreted as ascertaining something about which one may have doubt, or placing one’s trust in God Almighty before embarking on a dangerous trip.
