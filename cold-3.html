var content = "(Atmospheric) Cold temperature in a dream means poverty. A windy and cold weather in a dream means aggravation of one’s poverty. If it is sunny and cold, and if ones sees himself sitting in the sun, then the condition of his poverty will be removed. If one sees himself in a dream under the heat of the sun and seeks refuge away from it in the shade, it means that his stress and sadness will dissipate. If he sees that dream during the summertime, it means prosperity. If one sees himself seeking a fire or a smoke to warm himself with it in a dream means that one is seeking a job that entails danger. If it is burning coal which he seeks for warmth in the dream, then it means that he will swindle money from an orphan. Cold weather in winter is insignificant and in the summer in a dream it means that one’s travel plans will not take place. (Also see Cold weather)";
