var content = "(Cover | Hide | Farmer | Infidel | Ingratitude | Profane | Unbeliever | Ungodly) In a dream, seeing an irreligious person means meeting an enemy. Seeing an elderly person who is irreligious in a dream means meeting an old enemy whose hatred is clearly shown on his face. Seeing an irreligious housekeeper, or an old employee in a dream means suffering from the hidden evils of an avowed enemy. Becoming irreligious in a dream means embracing innovation, or whatever practices one considers and uses as his religion. Seeing an irreli- gious person sitting on a table with a plate of honey before him and refusing to eat from it in the dream means that he is ungrateful to his Lord, and that he does not confess to the innumerable favors which God Almighty has given him during this life. A gathering of irreligious people in a dream represents one’s children in their infancy. An irreligious person in a dream also represents a farmer who plants a seed, then when it becomes a seedling, he covers it with earth again. (Also see Disbelief)";
