There is a possibility that you are not working hard enough to get the results which would make the others pleased. Maybe there are some unfilled gaps at your work that supposed to be done and to satisfy the management, or maybe you do not pay enough attention to your partner. Make sure you know the item you have got at the bargain, as it could give more clue and explanation about this dream.";
