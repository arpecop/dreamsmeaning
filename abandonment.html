var content = "When you dream of being abandoned, it means that you have to forget your past and focus on your future. You’ve got to let go your past. The meaning of this dream is showing, that you have a fear of being wasted, left alone of the ones you love. You shouldn’t be afraid of people neglecting your feelings. The meaning of dreaming that you are abandoned, might mean that you’re suffering from recent lost or are afraid of loosing someone you love. The fear of abandonment might mean that you are getting better already, from what you’ve suffered before and are moving forward. This dream also can be the meaning of something you’ve suffered as being a child. When you abandon other people in your dream it can mean that you are shocked by the decisions you made earlier in your life. The main thing you have to do is to move forward in your life and do not regret for something you did or didn’t do.";
