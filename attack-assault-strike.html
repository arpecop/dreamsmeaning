var content = "When you dream of attacking someone, it means that your behaviour will have consequences to others. This dream about producing an aggressive and violent action against a person or a place is the sign that you are trying to let go your bad emotions. Also, dream of attacking or assaulting is better and easier way to feel that your behaviour disappointed you. If you see yourself being attacked by someone, it signifies the protection you have on yourself. At this moment of your life, you are feeling like no one cares about you and you want to be understood and looking out for help. If you dream of being attacked by the animal it symbolizes that you have to be careful with people you are surrounded by. Make sure you pay attention to someone in your life that have the same features just like the animal you dreamed of have. If you dream of attacking an animal yourself, it symbolizes that in some situation of your life you will be saved by someone you do not know personally.i feel such fear as all i dream is wolves attacking and theres alot of them and i cant save every dog we have ..i am hiding with the pets i could save and my dead parents are in some of these?";
