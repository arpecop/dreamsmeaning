var content = "(Brook | Creek | Irrigation | Rivulet | Watering) In a dream, a stream represents the course of one’s livelihood, his source of income, his shop, his trade, travels and the like interests. A stream in a dream also could mean festering wounds, waterskin, watering irrigation, the resting area on the highway, one’s throat which is the watering access of his body, or it could represent life if it is public property. If it is a private property, then it represents the life of the person who digs out such a stream. A stream in a dream also represents a good life, or the comfort of its owner. If its water flows over its banks in the dream, then it represents sorrows, crying, or sadness. If one sees a stream flowing through people’s homes in a dream, then such a stream represents a happy life and particularly when its water is colorless and sweet tasting. If one sees himself as the owner of a stream, a spring, or a watercourse which he establishes as a charity in a dream, it means that he will become a leader, a president, or happily serve his community. If one cleans a rivulet then finds it filthy again, or finds it filled with trash in his dream, it represents diarrhea. If he sees water flowing under his feet in a dream, then it means dropsy. If one sees a stream of water running through a town where people are filling their jars, drinking its water and thanking God for His blessings in a dream, it means that a calamity is removed and is replaced with peace, safety and tranquility. If the people are inflicted with adversities or a drought, then it means prosperity and rains, food, or money and their merchandise will not stagnate. If the water in the stream is murky, or salty, or running outside its canal, then it represents a coming calamity that will cause mass sufferings, or a sickness such as cold in the winter and fever in the summer, or it could mean that they will hear bad news about some travellers, or it could represent a richness which is acquired from an unlawful source, or it could mean that he will receive tainted money. If one sees a watercourse flowing only in the direction of his house, then such adversities will be his lot. If one sees a stream flowing in the direction of his house, or garden in a dream, it means a marriage or conceiving a child. A stream of flowing blood rather than water in a dream represents the deviation of one’s wife. If one sees a stream running off its course, or damaging people’s crops in a dream, it means bad news. Blocking the path of a stream in a dream means separation between a husband and a wife, or avoiding a sinful action between unmarried relatives. If one sees himself standing behind a rivulet in a dream, it means that his wife will inherit him. If one sees the water of a stream flowing toward his own home or garden, and if he finds that its water has turned into blood in the dream, it means that someone will marry his wife after him. Drinking fresh water from a rivulet, a stream, or a river in a dream represents the joy of living or longevity. A murky water of a rivulet or a stream in a dream means a fright, difficulties, or a sickness. Streams in a dream also represent the veins and the blood that flows through the human body.
