var content = "(Affiliation | Alliance | Business association) In a dream, business partnership means happiness, or it could mean exaggeration in one’s devotion toward God Almighty, or it could mean going to extremes to attain business success and prosperity in the world. If a poor person sees himself involved in a business partnership with a rich person in a dream, it means that he will become wealthy. If he is hoping for an inheritance, then seeing this dream means that it will come through, and that he will find abusiness partner. If one sees himself in a business partnership with a known person in a dream, it means that they deal justly and equitably with one another. If one’s partner in the dream is an unknown old person, then he represents his grandfather and such a year will be a prosperous business year for him. If one’s partner in the dream is a young man, then he represents an enemy, or it could mean that his opponent will be fair in dealing with him, though the person in the dream will remain suspicious but cannot legally dissolve his partnership. Partnership in a dream also means sincerity, loyalty, truthfulness and fulfilling one’s agreement.";
