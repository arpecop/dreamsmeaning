var content = "(The prophet Daniel, upon whom be peace.) If one sees him in a dream, it means that he will become a great scholar in interpreting the divine revelations. It is also said, that one who sees him (uwbp) in a dream may become a leader, a minister, acquire extensive knowledge, but yet suffers a painful persecution which he will later defeat. If one sees himself carrying the prophet Daniel, upon whom be peace, over his shoulders, sitting him beside a wall or talking to him, or if he sees the prophet Daniel talking to him, delivering glad tidings to him or feeding him honey with his own hand, it means that the person in the dream will become a great scholar or a commentator in religious interpretations.";
