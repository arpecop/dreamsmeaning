var content = "Dreaming of a wagon, denotes that you will be unhappily mated, and many troubles will prematurely age you. To drive one down a hill, is ominous of proceedings which will fill you with disquiet, and will cause you loss. To drive one up hill, improves your worldly affairs. To drive a heavily loaded wagon, denotes that duty will hold you in a moral position, despite your efforts to throw her off. To drive into muddy water, is a gruesome prognostication, bringing you into a vortex of unhappiness and fearful foreboding. To see a covered wagon, foretells that you will be encompassed by mysterious treachery, which will retard your advancement. For a young woman Dreaming that she drives a wagon near a dangerous embankment, portends that she will be driven into an illicit entanglement, which will fill her with terror, lest she be openly discovered and ostracised. If she drives across a clear stream of water, she will enjoy adventure without bringing opprobrium upon herself. A broken wagon represents distress and failure. ";
