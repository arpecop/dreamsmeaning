var content = "(Rodent | Thief | Woman) A mouse in a dream represents a dissolute and a sinful woman, a thief, or someone who feels flattered at exposing people’s private life. To see a large family of mice in one’s house in a dream means money and prosperity. If one sees a mouse playing inside his house where there is plenty of food in a dream, it means relief and money. If a mouse leaves one’s house in a dream, it means that blessings will depart from that house and its earnings will diminish. Owning a pet mouse in a dream means having a servant or a housekeeper. A black mouse and a white mouse in a dream represent the night and the day. Seeing a mouse of either black or white color going about its own business in the daylight in a dream means longevity. If one sees a mouse nibbling into one’s garment in a dream, it means that one will announce his intentions or goals. A mouse digging a hole in a dream represents a thief. A mouse in a dream also could represents a girlfriend, an opportunistic woman, or a lady friend who is hiding her true intentions. Catching a mouse in a dream also means befriending a woman, or marriage. Mice in a dream also mean elation, or ecstasy unless they are of mixed colors. Mice in a dream also represent the members of one’s household. Killing or catching a mouse in a dream means taking advantage of a woman. Throwing a stone or shooting an arrow at a mouse in a dream means backbiting or slandering a contemptible woman, or corresponding with her eliciting the unlawful. Seeing a family of mice inside a well or near a slanting land in a dream means nearing the end of one’s life. Seeing a large family of mice inside one’s house in a dream also could represent a gathering of women, or holding a party in one’s house. A mouse inside one’s shirt in a dream represents a woman friend out of whom no good can come. The skin of a mouse in a dream means little money which is taken from a vile woman.";
