var content = "Seeing string instruments in a dream means recovering from an illness, or they can represent man’s spinal cord, or his spinal column, strength, sternness, relentlessness, health condition, or physical fitness. Seeing string instruments in a dream also means gaining some understanding about human nature, or the physiology of the human being, or they could represent medicine or astronomy. If a bachelor sees string instruments in his dream, it may mean that he will get married. If a wife sees herself playing a string instrument in her dream, it means that she will put a child in her lap. If one sees himself playing a string instrument in front of the governor’s house in a dream, it means that he will preside over people should he qualify. Otherwise, it could mean that he will piece together or fabricate a story. Seeing a lute or a guitar in a dream denotes no harm if one sees them or intends to hold them, except if one hears their music. Playing or hearing a string instrument in a dream represents lies. Playing them in one’s house in a dream represent a calamity that will befall that family. It is also said that playing such an instrument in a dream also means winning fame and presiding over others, though it could also denote distress for the player. If a string of such an instrument breaks in a dream, it means relaxation and relief from stress. A broken string of a lute or a guitar or similar instrument in a dream represents a precious property that causes its owner a headache. Every time he remembers it, he suffers from heartburn or stomach pain. Seeing such an instrument by a layman or a hard- working person in a dream means consolation and a lesson to learn from life. Seeing it by an insolent person in a dream means further corruption, while if a a tyrant or an unjust person sees it in a dream, it means oppressing others, terrorizing them and cuttingthem off from their families. (Also see Banjo | Musician)";
