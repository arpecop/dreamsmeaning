var content = "(Women) In a dream, ribs represent women. Whatever may affect one’s ribs in a dream will manifest in his wife, for it is said that Eve was created from Adam’s rib. Ribs in a dream represent a protective shield. Their parable is like that of a tent and its pillars, a house and its foundation, the roof of a house, or a boat and its boards. Ribs in a dream also represent relatives of different social environments, or they could represent their stations of love, unity, compassion toward one another, or help they render to one another. Ribs in a dream also denote secret deeds or concealed actions. Ribs in a dream also mean punish- ment. If one sees his ribs standing out, or exposed in a dream, he may face punishment for a crime or a sin he has committed. If one’s ribs grow strong and the flesh surrounding them becomes healthier in a dream, then they represent prosperity, recovering from an illness, gaining weight, or growing fat. If one sees himself in a dream without ribs, it means that he will lose what the ribs represent of either a wife, a child, money or perhaps, he could have engaged in something wrong, thinking it to be right. One’s ribs in a dream also mean a sickness, or bending of one’s shoulders because of old age. Eating one’s own ribs in a dream means becoming a burden to his family and relatives, or it could mean that he may sell wood for living, or work at a lumberyard. (Also see Body 1 )";
