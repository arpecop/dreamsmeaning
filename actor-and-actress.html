var content = "To see in your dreams an actress, denotes that your present state will be one of unbroken pleasure and favor. To see one in distress, you will gladly contribute your means and influence to raise a friend from misfortune and indebtedness. If you think yourself one, you will have to work for subsistence, but your labors will be pleasantly attended. If you dream of being in love with one, your inclination and talent will be allied with pleasure and opposed to downright toil. To see a dead actor, or actress, your good luck will be overwhelmed in violent and insubordinate misery. To see them wandering and penniless, foretells that your affairs will undergo a change from promise to threatenings of failure. To those enjoying domestic comforts, it is a warning of revolution and faithless vows. For a young woman dreaming that she is engaged to an actor, or about to marry one, foretells that her fancy will bring remorse after the glamor of pleasure has vanished. If a man dreams that he is sporting with an actress, it foretells that private broils with his wife, or sweetheart, will make him more misery than enjoyment. ";
