var content = "(Beam | Gleam | Radiance | Shine) Light in a dream means guidance. Walking from a dark place into the light in a dream means receiving guidance, divine acceptance and protection in this world and in the hereafter, and it represents richness after poverty, honor after humiliation, repentance following sin, sight after blindness and the opposite is also true should one see himself walking from light into darkness in a dream. Light in a dream also means Islam, or submission to God Almighty. Seeing light in a dream denotes good deeds, knowledge, the Holy Qur’an, or a righteous son. In a dream, light also may mean trials and tribulations. Wearing a raiment of light in a dream means receiving knowledge, or it could represent one’s growing devotion. If one sees light beaming from his body in a dream, it means that he will be gifted with a son who will grow to be a man of great knowledge, spiritual rank, and whose prayers are accepted. Thus, whatever he ask, God Almighty will grant. Light in a dream also represents a messenger, knowledge, or it could mean accomplishing one’s needs in the light. Light in a dream also represents the sun, the moon, the daylight, sunshine, moonlight, the crescent moon, or the Arabic proper name Shams. (Also see Earth | Lantern)";
