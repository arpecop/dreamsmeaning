var content = "To see a dog in your dream, symbolize a skill that you have not used, ignored or even forgotten. This skill needs to be activated. Alternatively, dogs may indicate intuition, loyalty, protection, generosity and fidelity. Dreaming of dog shows, that your own values and intentions will enable you to go forward in the world and succeed. If the dog is vicious and &#x2F; or to dream that dog is growling, then it signifies some inner conflict within yourself. It may indicate betrayal and untrustworthiness. If the dog is dead or dying in dream, then it symbolizes a loss of a good friend. Alternatively, it represents a deterioration of your instincts. To dream that a dog bites your on the leg, suggests that you have lost your ability to balance aspects of your life. You may be hesitant in approaching a new situation or have no desire to move forward with your goals. To see a happily barking dog in your dream, indicates pleasures, friendship and much social activity in your life. If the dog is barking ferociously, then it represents your habit of making demands on people and controlling situations around you. It could also indicate unfriendly or dangerious companions. To dream that you are buying a dog, indicates your inclination to bribe or buy your friends or buy compliments &#x2F; favors. Alternatively, it suggest a need for you to find friendship, companionship and new place in society. Dreaming that you are dressing up your dog with clothes, signifies your attempts to cover up your own character imperfections, flaws and habits. Also you must reconsider the conceptions associated with the word dog, such as loyalty (man’s best friend) and to be “treated like a dog”. ";
