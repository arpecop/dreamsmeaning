var content = "(Pin | Pole | Stake | Tent peg) In a dream, a peg represents a high ranking person, a master, or a scholar. If a young man hits someone over his back with a wooden stick in a dream, it means that he will beget a son who will grow to be a hypocrite and an enemy to his father. Unplugging a peg or the pole of a tent in a dream means death. Driving a peg into the wall in a dream means liking to associate oneself with a great person. Driving a peg into a house in a dream means being in love with a woman from that family. Driving a wooden peg or a pin into wood in a dream means liking to befriend a teenager who is also a hypocrite. A metal peg in a dream represents money, strength, pain, distress, sorrow, or rising to a high ranking position to become firmly established therein. It also means being drafted to accept a governmental position, or it could mean impeachment from office or travels. If a peg is interpreted to represent a son or a wife in a dream, then it denotes longevity. Standing on top of a pole in a dream means acquiring knowledge from a great scholar. A peg in a dream also implies money, love, marriage, distress, sorrow, or hypocrisy.";
