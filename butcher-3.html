var content = "A butcher in a dream represents the angel of death. Taking a knife from a butcher in a dream means falling sick, then recovering from one’s illness to become strong and healthy again. In a dream, a butcher also represents a man who causes destruction or evil, and particularly if he is seen holding his cutting knife, or if he is wearing a white uniform stained with blood. If one sees himself as a butcher wearing clean cloths, it represents longevity. A good looking butcher in a dream represents a prosperous culmination of one’s life, or changing one’s trade. If someone looks at him with despise or in the wrong way in the dream, it means that something is unlawful in what he sells. If the butcher is a man in the dream, he then represents the angel of death. Whatever place he appears in will bear the consequences. A butcher in a dream also represents an unjust person. In a dream, if one sees a butcher who specializes in selling animal heads, he represents a guardian of people’s estates, or a treasurer of a company, he also could represent adversities or death. If the animals’ heads cannot be identified in the dream, and if they still have their skin, hair, and are dripping blood in the dream, then it means the disappearance of the people of knowledge and that knowledge will become selectively disseminated by political leaders. Catties’ heads here represent people in danger. Buying an animal’s head from a butcher in a dream means asking one’s superior for a teacher for a special training, a coach, a continuing education program, or a better job. If a butcher slaughters an animal for fun in a dream, it means suspicion about one’s spiritual standing. Walking in a butchers market in a dream means adversities, sufferings, a quick death for sick people, loss of wealth for rich people, or the fear of people who are under oppression, or the scare of a person in debt concerning his family or property, or the fears of a person awaiting a court judgment. It is also said that a butcher in a dream represents tyranny and bloodshed. If a prisoner sees a butcher in his dream, it means that he will soon be released fromjail. Seeing a butcher in a dream also signifies safety, dispelling fears, protection, silence, vanquishing one’s enemy, or it could mean meeting with a persuasive travel agent. (Also see Meat)";
