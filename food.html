var content = "(Man’s food | Dinner | Digesting food | Invitation | Lunch) Food which is placed on a ceramic plate or on a clay plate in a dream represents lawful earnings. If food is served on a forbidden golden or silver platter in the dream, it represents unlawful money, extensive debts, eating and chewing one’s food with desire and gluttony. Swallowing what one is chewing means debts or collectors demanding their money. Eating with the right hand in a dream means success. Eating with the left hand in a dream means falling in the trap of one’s enemy and displeasing one’s friends. Eating from someone else’s hand in a dream means good absti- nence and trusting in God Almighty as one’s sole sustainer. Eating from someone else’s hand in a dream also can be interpreted as a sickness or inability to eat with one’s own hand. Eating sweets in a dream means solving a problem through kindness. If the food is greasy in the dream, it means that one’s problem is a lasting one. Sour food in a dream means steadfastness. Sour food in one’s mouth in a dream also means pain and sufferings. Yellow food in a dream means sickness, except for fowl’s meat. Drinking food the way one drinks liquids in a dream means increase in one’s earnings. Eating at a wedding in a dream means glad tidings. Eating at a reception after a funeral in a dream means distress and sorrow. Any food that has a long shelf life in a dream means profits and continuous benefits. Meat, eggplant, squash or the like food in a dream represent temporary benefit or seasonal earnings. Eating at the tables of royalties or rich people in a dream means rising in rank, or renewing the mandate of one’s office. Eating squash in a dream also means guidance, following the true religious precepts, or it could mean vigilance. Eating food from the table of people of knowledge in a dream means acquiring knowledge, guidance, wisdom and blessings. Eating food from the plate of a policeman or a soldier in a dream means committing adultery or receiving money from an unlawful source. Eating the food of poor people or pious ones in a dream means repentance from sin or receiving guidance. Eating the food of nomads or bedouins in a dream means travels, rising in station or changes in one’s conditions. Eating a meal that is cooked with meat in a dream means richness for a poor person. Eating a meal that is cooked without meat in a dream also may mean poverty, or it could mean devotion. If one’s meal turns into something better in the dream, it means advancement in one’s spiritual life. If one’s food turns bitter or sour in the dream, it means changing a spouse or a job. If one cookes a tasty meal in a dream, it means attaining a high ranking job, or it could mean prospering after suffering from a painful poverty. If someone else cooks one’s meal in the dream, it means dealing with a treachrous person and in this case, it means that one should fear for his life or about doing business with him, or it could mean that he may receive a helping hand in doing his job. If one eats an unbearably hot food in a dream, it means adversities. If one finds his mouth filled with food, and if there is still a cavity for more food in the dream, it means confusion, or it could represent the balance of his life in this world. If one manages to grind and swallow the food in his mouth in a dream, it means that he will overcome his difficulties. Receiving a sour or a bitter tasting food from someone in a dream means hearing harsh words, and the same interpretation is given if one offers someone sour or bitter food in a dream. If he eats it, then it means sorrow, sadness and distress. If one finds himself eating it patiently and thanks God Almighty for it in the dream, it means that he will escape from such dangers. (Also see Chewing food | Guest | Hospitality | Swallowing | Table)Hi, I hope you can help me. I had a dream of a deceased old woman who was like a mother to me while she was alive. In my dream shes preparing a tasty meal for me while her son is wathing with jealous eyes. I went to do something else and when I returned and looked for my meal it stood next to the son, but not what I expected, only a few cooked patatoes and rice and I think a worm was making his way to my food cause it stood on the ground. In my dream I knew she would never give me such a meal. But still I did have another plate with a much tastier meal. What do all this mean? ";
