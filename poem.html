var content = "Memorizing a poem or a verse from a poem in a dream means engaging in a business from which one will acquire great knowledge, or it could mean profits or success in whatever trade one chooses to practice. If one sees himself in a court of justice reciting poems for money in the dream, it means that he will give a false testimony. If he recites a poem for a gathering in a dream, it means that he will relate a wise saying, though he himself inclines to hypocrisy. If one sees himself listening to a poem in a dream, it means that he will associate himself with a group of people who do not foster the truth. In a dream, poems also represent falsehood or vain talk. Reciting a poem or listening to one and memorizing its verses in a dream means that one should take heed to what it says. If the poem one is listening to in his dream contains wisdom or a divine revelation, then it does mean good. Composing a poem, or memorizing it in a dream also means losing one’s status, dismissal from one’s job, weakness in one’s religious adherence, suffering from depression, adversities, suffering from slander by one’s enemy, or it could represent a crafty ploy. If one composes a defamatory poem or a satirical poem in a dream, it means that he slanders others for fun or profit. If it is lauding someone, then it means that he will become poor. If he sings his poem with a melody in the dream, it represents a satirical attitude toward someone, doubt about someone, or failure to complete one’s work. (Also see Poet)";
