var content = "A water melon in a dream represents a sick person with many problems including suppression of urine. A melon in a dream also means that one will be struck with an adversity for which he will find no solution, and he will not understand its consequences for sometime to come. Eating a water melon in a dream also means release from prison. If one sees himself extending his hands to the heavens from where he receives a water melon in the dream, it means that he is seeking a job in the government or a wealth which he shall shortly receive. A ripened water melon in a dream means a sickness, while a green and unripened melon means youth and a good health. Honeydew in a dream represent a group of men and women who possess good character and manners. In a dream, a melon also represents a beautiful woman though with bad qualities.";
