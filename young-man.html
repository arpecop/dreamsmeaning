var content = "(Teenage boy) An unknown young man in a dream represents an enemy. If the young man is known in the dream, then whatever strength, harshness, weaknesses, deceit, perfidy, or character he displays, they denote the same character in wakefulness. Walking behind an unknown young man in a dream means pursuing one’s enemy and conquering him. If one meets an unknown young man whom he dislikes in a dream, it means that such an enemy will surface and people will abhor him. If one happens to like him in the dream, then it means that he will face an enemy whom most people like and sympathize with. If a young man sees himself turned into an old person in a dream, it means that he will suffer major losses in his life. A young man or a teenager in a dream mostly represents an enemy, for a teenager rarely respects or heeds the advice of his peers. A young man in a dream also represents deceit, betrayal, energy, or stubbornness, though he also could represent blessings and gratitude.";
