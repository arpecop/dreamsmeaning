var content = "(Hand) In a dream, the palm of one’s hand represents one’s fitness in wakefulness. Clapping one’s hands in a dream could either mean joy and happiness, or it could mean nothing in wakefulness. Carrying a glove in one’s hand in a dream means ceasing the course of wrongdoing. Slapping one’s own face with both hands means sorrow, sadness, or calamities. Hitting the top of one’s hand into the palm of the other hand means separation. In a dream, the palm of one’s hand also represents one’s strength. To stretch open one’s palm in a dream signifies wealth and prosperity. Holding a tight fist in a dream implies poverty, or tight living conditions. If one sees hair growing in the palm of his hand in a dream, it means depression, distress and debts. Growing hair on top of one’s hand in a dream indicates one’s strength or virility. Seeing one’s hand hanging down from the skies in a dream denotes one’s connections with the ruler or people in authority. A stretched hand from the skies in a dream also could mean profits and blessings for a hunter, a builder and a real estate professional. In a dream, the palm of one’s hand also represents his world. It also may mean ceasing a certain course of action. If one finds himself afraid, then sees the palm of a hand holding out before him in a dream, it means that his fears will be dispelled. A large and a stretched palm in a dream means prosperity and generosity. A close fist in a dream means stinginess. A nice looking palm of one’s hand also signifies abstaining from evil, or failing to pay charity. The palm of one’s hand in a dream also represents one’s prayers and supplications, comfort, seeking the comfort of others, or receiving benefits from others. The palm of one’s hand in a dream also represents a year, ways of life, money, leadership, a son, courage and desisting from evildoing. (See Desisting from evildoing)";
