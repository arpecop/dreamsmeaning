var content = "(Bleeding | Cut | Injury) A wound in a dream means compensation money that will come out of an injury one may suffer, and it will show. A cut in the right hand in a dream means money which is earned from a family business. If the left hand receives the cut, such profits will come through a female relative. If one sees his left foot bleeding from a cut, it means that he will earn money from a farming business. If his injury is in his back, then such profits will come from his children. If his wound starts bleeding in the dream, it means a debt which he must repay, even if it is difficult for him to do so at present. Every bleeding wound in a dream represents a financial obligation. In a dream, a head wound which does not bleed is a sign that one should guard his money. A wound which does not bleed in a dream also represents recognition by others. If a man of authority is wounded in an accident, whereby his flesh splits open, and his bones are dissected in a dream, it means that he will live a long life to see the burial of most of his relatives. If an army general sees his left hand wounded in a dream, it means that his army will double in size. If his right hand is wounded in the dream, it means that the area of his control will expand. If one suffers from a wound in his stomach in the dream, it means growth in his financial standing. If one is wounded in his thigh in the dream, it means that his clan will grow stronger. If one sees himself wounded in his legs in a dream, it means longevity. If one’s foot is wounded in the dream, it means that his authority and control will become firmer. If one receives a cut and no blood runs out of his wound in a dream, it means that the assailant will say something true about his victim, representing the answer the person in the dream needs to realize. A bleeding wound in a dream also means being subject to backbiting, though what will be said is true. If one sees an angel piercing his stomach with a sword, whereby he thinks that he is dead in the dream, it means that he may suffer from an ulcer which will ultimately heal. If the sword inflicts a wound in his neck in a dream, it means prosperity which will mostly benefit his progeny. (Also see Horizontal wound | Surgery | Vertical wound)";
