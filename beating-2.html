var content = "(Blow | Hit | Lash | Whip) To hit someone with a staff in a dream means bringing back to life something that died away or investigating the cause of a death or clarifying something. To beat someone with a wooden stick in a dream means failing to fulfill a promise, or it could mean lying to someone. If someone in authority hits his employee in a dream, it means that he will give him a raise. If he hits him on his back in the dream, it means that he will pay his debt. If he hits him on his backside in the dream, it means that he will give him a daughter in marriage. If one hits someone head with a stick in a dream, it means that he desires his position or it may denote his jealousy. If one hits someone between the eyes in a dream, it means that he wants him to get lost. Beating someone in a dream also means to rebuke, revile or insult him, or it could mean to admonish him. Beating someone over his scull in a dream means that the victim in the dream will attain excellence of expression and reach his goals. If he hits him over the earlobe and if it bleeds in the dream, it means that the assailant will rape and deflower the daughter of the victim. Like that, interpreting the subject of beating must be associated with the meaning of the limb affected in the dream. (See Body’). Beatings in a dream also connotes supplications. If one sees himself beating a donkey in a dream, it means that he does not earn his daily bread unless he regularly prays for it. To beat someone in a dream also means cursing him. If he hits him over the head in the dream, it means speaking ill of him and that one cannot retrieve his words or apologize for them. Beating a family member in a dream means that one’s wife is committing adultery. Beating someone in a dream also means benefiting him, or it could mean business losses. If one is beaten in a dream, it means profits and benefits, unless if the one beating him is an angel, or a deceased person, or a member of his family. Beating someone with a leather belt or with a cane in a dream means bad consequences in wakefulness. Hitting the floor in a dream means taking a trip. If one receives one hundred lashes on his back in a dream, it means that he has committed adultery, or it could mean that he has the intention to do so. If one receives forty lashes in a dream, it means that he indulges in drinking alcohol or uses intoxicants. If he is lashed eighty times in a dream, it means that he slanders married women. If he is whipped by a deceased person in the dream, it means that he is pursuing wrong ideas and should reverse his course, for a deceased person dwells in the kingdom of truth and follows only what pleased God Almighty. However, if one sees himself in a dream beating a deceased person, this could be interpreted to denote the strength of his faith, certitude, prayers and charitable nature. It also could mean benefits from a business trip or pursuing a lost interest. Beating in a dream when it causes no pain, bleeding or scratches means receiving a new garment, paying debts, or hearing sarcastic comments. Beating an animal in a dream means either training him, or it could mean ignorance and being unfair toward such an animal.";
