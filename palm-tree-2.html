var content = "(Date palm) A palm tree in a dream represents a sire, a scholar, a noble man or a wise man who imparts his knowledge and wisdom to others. Cutting a palm tree in a dream means the death of such a man. Seeing a plantation of palm trees, or an oasis or palm trees in a dream mean leadingpeople and guiding them on the straight path. If a merchant or a trader sees a palm tree in his dream, it means business success. If a shopkeeper sees a palm tree in his dream, it also means profits. A dead and dried out palm tree in a dream represents a hypocrite. To uproot a palm tree in a dream means that a plague will befall that place, or it could mean suffering from the persecution of an unjust ruler. Uprooting a palm tree in a dream also means a dead end to one’s plans, or it could mean a dispute. A palm tree in a dream also represents one’s paternal aunt. Palm trees in a dream also represent Arab women. If one sees a seedling become a big palm tree in a dream, it means that a child in that community will grow to be a great scholar. It also connotes that a weak person will grow strong. Seeing a palm tree in a dream also means longevity, a scholar, a teacher, children, a wife, a house, a property, a king, a year, new clothing, money, or bearing a child. To prune or trim a palm tree in a dream means that one’s adversity at his work or related to his travels will be dispelled. (Also see Palmyra | Tree)";
