var content = "(Broker | Stockbroker | Wood warm) In a dream, termites represent jealousy, envy, perfidy, competition in knowledge, or search for arguments. If one sees termites in his carry -on bag, or eating from his staff in a dream, they mean his death. Termites in a dream also represent a slanderer who tricks wealthy people to make his commission by advising them to place their money into bad investments. If a sick person sees termites inside his house or clinging to his skin in a dream, it also means his death. If one sees termites eating his wooden door, table or bed in a dream, they mean an illness. Termites in a dream also means having a large family with little income.";
