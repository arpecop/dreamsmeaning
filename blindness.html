var content = "(Gold | Heedlessness | Inheritance | Poverty) In a dream, blindness means heedlessness, misguidance or receiving an inheritance. A blind man in a dream represents a poor person and because of his poverty, his actions mostly harm his religious life. Blindness in a dream also means a calamity, an accident, a misfortune, sadness, harm, sorrows and distress. If a blind man sees himself wrapped with new cloth in a dream, it means his death. If one sees himself blind in a dream, it means debts he owes, or a pilgrimage he must attend. If one is blinded in a dream, it means that he will betray his covenant with his Lord. Becoming blind in a dream means suffering from poverty and becoming needy after being rich, or it could mean satisfaction and contentment, or it could mean losing a dear person. If one’s sight explodes with a lightning in a dream, it means his death. Blindness also could denote deafness, disregarding the world or renouncing it or hiding one’s secrets. As for a foreigner, seeing himself blind in a dream means never returning to his homeland. Blindness in a dream for a prisoner means his release from jail. If a seeker, a student, or a businessman sees himself blind in a dream, it means that he may never reach his goals. (Also see Body’ | Destruction | Eyes | Fear | One-eyed | World)";
