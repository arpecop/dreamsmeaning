var content = "In a dream, itching means poverty and suffering from the pressures of a demanding wife and children. If one’s itching results in bleeding or puss in the dream, it means that they will get what they want. Otherwise, one’s toiling for his livelihood will prolong. If one sees himself itching in a dream, it also means that he will investigate the conditions of his relatives and suffer from their state. If one’s itching seems to last with no solution in sight in the dream, it means that he will suffer from a condition he cannot bear in wakefulness. If one sees people on the road afflicted with itching in a dream, it means that he will earn money but with a headache. A state he will become known by it. (Also see Mangy | Plague | Scratching)";
