var content = "(Climbing | Rising) To see oneself ascending in the skies in a dream means falling in rank, or it could mean oppressing oneself. If one sees himself ascending in the skies until he reaches the stars, merges with them and if he becomes a star in the dream, it means that he will receive titles and powers. If one sees himself ascending a mountain it means depression, stress and travels. However, rising in a dream means elevation of status, and descending means a backslide. If one sees himself walking up a steep road in a dream, it means rising in status, but involving toiling and hardships. If one sees himself climbing a mountain, then the mountain in a dream is interpreted as one’s goal. Thus, one’s dream may mean attaining one’s goal as far as he reaches in his climb. In dream interpretation, any ascent of a mountain, a trail, a hill, an elevation or even climbing a roof means attaining one’s goal or satisfying one’s needs. To see oneself climbing flat on his back in a dream then means uncalled for, or unnecessary hardship. (Also see Air | Ascent | Climbing a mountain | Flying)";
