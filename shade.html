var content = "(Changes | Cover | Shelter) Witnessing a shade in the summertime in a dream means comfort, profits, honor, or becoming the protege of a great person. If one sees a shade in the winter in a dream then it means trouble, distress, adversities, or soliciting the company of people who foster innovation. Shade in a dream also represents the governor of one’s town, a man of knowledge, a pious person, an ascetic, or a religious student on the path. Seeking refuge in the shade away from the heat of the sun in a dream means comfort, profits, or escaping from harm. As for a woman, shade in her dream represents her husband. If an unmarried woman sees herself seeking the shade in a dream, it means her marriage and that she will marry a rich and a powerful person. If one finds it cold to sit in the shade in his dream, then if he seeks to sit under the sun to worm himself up, it means that his poverty will be dispelled, for cold in a dream also means poverty.
