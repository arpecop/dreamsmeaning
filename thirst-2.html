var content = "(Desire | Dryness) In a dream, thirst represents stagnation of businesses, dullness of the real estate market and unsalability of farm products. Thirst in a dream also means poverty, slump, recession, or yearning for a beloved, desiring to be with him and missing him. Thirst in a dream also could represent religious corruption. If a thirsty person sees himself searching for water but could not find it in a dream, it means that he will escape from a misfortune. If one sees himself standing thirsty before a source of water or a well but cannot drink from it or reach it in a dream, it means that he will fail to reach his goal. Thirst in a dream also means being corrupt, or it could represent one’s need to get married to preserve his chastity.";
