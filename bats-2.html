var content = "Awful is the fate of the unfortunate dreamer of this ugly animal. Sorrows and calamities from hosts of evil work against you. Death of parents and friends, loss of limbs or sight, may follow after a dream of these ghoulish monsters. A white bat is almost a sure sign of death. Often the death of a child follows this dream. My brother has dreamed about a gold colour bat has bitten him on his neck on left and right side.Can u post to my email about this dream meaningToo late I’m reading this. 2 months ago I saw a dream of white bat hanging on a tree, i know where the tree is located, next to a small restaurant nearby my house , sky was silver colored, I was standing with my sister’s husband under this tree, he pulled the bat down by his tail and kept him for some time to take a close look at this animal, the bat was huge, the size of a dog with a tail, big wrinkled wings and face, all white, trying to escape. I was very disgusted and felt i will vomit. I told him to let the creature go.….. Now, few days ago my sister’s husband bought some take away food from that restaurant, my sister is pregnant with twins, the food was expired and they all get poisoned, she entered the hospital, 1 of her fetus was poisoned to death, but the other fetus was saved. i know its a said story, but i was shocked by reading this explanation, and i have to share it.";
