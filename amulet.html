var content = "(Incantation | Prayer | Talisman | A prayer worn around the neck or cherished to word off evil and attract good fortune.) When a prayer is read in a dream following the prophetic traditions to help a sick person in the dream, it means protection from sufferings, dispelling distress and dissipation of sadness. If the amulet or the talisman carries a personal spell or wish, then it is nothing but lies, falsehood, affectation and hypocrisy. If the person who recites the incantation in the dream is a craftsperson, it means that he defrauds the people and fakes his product. If he is a man of knowledge, it means that he lies or hides his true knowledge, abstains from giving true advice, or perhaps he offers a poor quality of worship. If the one reciting the incantation in the dream is a judge, it means that he will give a wrong judgement. If one is given to drink some water over which specific prayers were recited in a dream, it means longevity. If one sees himself reciting an incantation, or if he hears incantations recited on his behalf in a dream, it will all be false except for a prayer that recites – ‘In the Name of God, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate’ or contains a Qur’anic revelation.";
