var content = "If one sees himself as a store owner, sitting in his shop, surrounded with his merchandise, giving orders, buying and selling in a dream, it means a commanding post in his own field. If the person is not a businessman, but still sees himself in a dream carrying some trade tools such as a scale, a scoop, etcetera, it means financial balance in his life. Merchants in a dream also represent travel, news, profits or a high position. A merchant in a dream also may represent a spendthrift, or negligence of several religious obligations set by God Almighty. A woman merchant in a dream represents an enemy. (Also see Grain merchant)";
