var content = "Dreaming of dying, foretells that you are threatened with evil from a source that has contributed to your former advancement and enjoyment. To see others dying, forebodes general ill luck to you and to your friends. Dreaming that you are going to die, denotes that unfortunate inattention to your affairs will depreciate their value. Illness threatens to damage you also. To see animals in the throes of death, denotes escape from evil influences if the animal be wild or savage. It is an unlucky dream to see domestic animals dying or in agony. [As these events of good or ill approach you they naturally assume these forms of agonizing death, to impress you more fully with the joyfulness or the gravity of the situation you are about to enter on awakening to material responsibilities, to aid you in the mastery of self which is essential to meeting all conditions with calmness and determination.] See Death.
