var content = "(Excessive admiration or adulation of someone in a dream.) Ingratiating oneself to someone for worldly profits, or to gain access to knowledge, or to find a job to help him better apply his religious obligations in a dream means honor, correcting one’s religious practices or attaining one’s spiritual goals. It also means evil consequences if one does not usually strive after such needs, or if he presents his needs too favorably, or if he does so in a dream soliciting favors from a woman he knows. It also means escaping from the dangers of his enemy. However, flaterry and ingratiating oneself to others in a dream also could mean giving preference to others’ needs over one’s own, trueness and being charitable. (Also see Adulation)";
