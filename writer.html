var content = "(Author | Book | Letter | Scribe | Secretary | Starling | Write) A writer in a dream represents a dishonest, cunning, deceitful and a fraudulent person. If a writer sees himself unlettered in a dream, it means that he will forget his pranks, or lose his mind, or waste his religion, or develop a weak spiritual standing, or become poor. If one sees himself as an unlettered person, then if he suddenly becomes a writer in a dream, it means that he will develop pranks and deceive his opponent or enemy. Discovering oneself as a writer in a dream means that one will attend to the comfort of others rather than to his own comfort. Consequently he will get exhausted from such exercise and find that he gained nothing from it. If a sick person sees such a dream, it means his death. If a worker sees that dream, then it connotes his honesty and loyalty, or it could mean that he will be promoted, or get a raise from his employer. A writer in a dream also represents a tailor, a farmer, or a locomotive engineer. Seeing a scribe, or the secretary of managerial people, or someone in authority in a dream means that one may become one of them, or it could mean that he will rise in station, or improve his life.
