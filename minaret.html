var content = "(Spiritual guide | Letter carrier | Lighthouse | Minaret of a mosque) In a dream, the minaret of a mosque represents a righteous man who fosters unity and love between people, who calls them to live by their religious covenant and guides them on the path of God Almighty. If a minaret is demolished in a dream, it represents the death of such a spiritual guide, fading of his name, dispersal of his community, and perhaps it could lead to the reversal of their conditions. The minaret of the city’s central mosque in a dream represents a letter carrier, or a guide calling people to God’s path. Falling down from the top of a minaret into a well in a dream means marrying a strong minded woman who uses vicious expressions, when one already has a pious wife with whom he enjoys peace and tranquility. It also means losing one’s authority or control. Climbing a wooden minaret and calling people to prayers in a dream means attaining authority and rising in station through hypocrisy. Sitting alone on the top of a minaret, praising God’s glory and glorifying His oneness in a dream means becoming famous, while the loud glorifications mean that one’s distress and sorrow will be lifted by God’s leave. The minaret of a mosque in a dream also represents the chief minister of the ruler, or it could represent the muezzin. (Also see Lantern | Mailman | Masjid | Mosque | Muezzin | Watchtower)";
