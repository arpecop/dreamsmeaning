var content = "For a young woman Dreaming that she is alone on a turbulent and muddy lake, foretells many vicissitudes are approaching her, and she will regret former extravagances, and disregard of virtuous teaching. If the water gets into the boat, but by intense struggling she reaches the boat-house safely, it denotes she will be under wrong persuasion, but will eventually overcome it, and rise to honor and distinction. It may predict the illness of some one near her. If she sees a young couple in the same position as herself, who succeed in rescuing themselves, she will find that some friend has committed indiscretions, but will succeed in reinstating himself in her favor. Dreaming of sailing on a clear and smooth lake, with happy and congenial companions, you will have much happiness, and wealth will meet your demands. A muddy lake, surrounded with bleak rocks and bare trees, denotes unhappy terminations to business and affection. A muddy lake, surrounded by green trees, portends that the moral in your nature will fortify itself against passionate desires, and overcoming the same will direct your energy into a safe and remunerative channel. If the lake be clear and surrounded by barrenness, a profitable existence will be marred by immoral and passionate dissipation. To see yourself reflected in a clear lake, denotes coming joys and many ardent friends. To see foliaged trees reflected in the lake, you will enjoy to a satiety Love’s draught of passion and happiness. To see slimy and uncanny inhabitants of the lake rise up and menace you, denotes failure and ill health from squandering time, energy and health on illicit pleasures. You will drain the utmost drop of happiness, and drink deeply of Remorse’s bitter concoction. ";
