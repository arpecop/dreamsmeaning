var content = "(A mountain short-winged and a stout-bodied bird | Mountain quail | Par- tridge | Woman) In a dream, a mountain quail represents a thief, a confidant, or a pimp who secretly conducts his business of soliciting clients for his prostitutes. However, a quail in a dream also represents a blessed food, an answer to one’s prayers, repelling a calamity, or overcoming an adversity. In dream interpretation, a quail also could represent a double-faced person. If a hobbyist finds himself seeking to hear the cry of a quail in a dream, it means profits from suspicious sources, or earnings made from reciting poems, singing, gambling, or it could mean squandering money. In this sense, seeing a quail in a dream could represent a crime which is punishable by death or life imprison- ment.";
