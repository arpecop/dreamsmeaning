var content = "(Guild) If one sees himself flying with wings in a dream, it means travel. Wings in a dream also represent one’s children. If one sees his wings feathered, this could represent his prosperity or authority. If someone sees himself flying with someone else’s wings in the dream, it means that he will receive his help and support. In that sense, traditional people say – “So and so flew with so and so’s wings.” Having wings and not using them to fly with in a dream means acquiring worldly wealth. A broken wing in a dream represents a severe illness one’s son may attract. If one experiences the excruciating pain from his wings being pulled off his shoulders in a dream, it may mean the death of his son. A wing that does not allow one to fly in a dream means a wound or a permanent scar in one’s life that will slow his progress. It also could represent a punishment for one’s sins. (Also see Arm 1 | Transformation)";
