var content = "(Abattoir) A slaughterhouse in a dream represents loss of lives, the return of souls to their Lord, bloodshed, skinning animals, or it could mean fetidness. A slaughterhouse in a dream also means weddings, festivities, celebrations and banquets, or it could represent tyranny, adultery, or a brothel. If a sick person sees himself entering a slaughterhouse in a dream, it means the end of his life and the dividing of his assets after his death. If a healthy person enters a slaughterhouse and if his garment become stained with blood in a dream, it means a sickness, adversities, or debts. If one sees hogs or pigs being slaughtered therein, his dream means that he will witness the end of innovators, the contemptible, the evil ones, and the abominable people. Meanwhile, if people are afraid of someone, the dream then signals the end of such a person. A slaughterhouse in a dream also represents a dungeon, a torture room, or a primitive prison. Entering a slaughterhouse in a dream may also mean that the police is investigating allegations related to such a person. A slaughterhouse in a dream also represents a procuress or a white slaver. (Also see Slaughter)";
