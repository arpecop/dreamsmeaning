var content = "(Bun | Tuft | Wisp) If a pregnant woman sees a strand of hair in her dream, it means that she will beget a blessed son. A strand of hair hanging over one’s head in a dream means money. Carrying several tufts in a dream represents one’s neighbors. If a woman sees herself having a long strand of hair in a dream, it means that her son will become a leader. If she sees her hair thick in the dream, it means that she will do something that will make her famous. If people see her thick strand of hair, it means that she will be exposed for something wrong she has committed. Black hair represents a respected and a handsome looking husband. If the woman sees herself without a head cover in a dream, it means that her husband has left her and he will not return back to her. If she is not married, it means that she will never marry. If she sees herself having charcoal colored hair in a dream, it means that she will live from her husband’s wealth or inheritance. (Also see Black hair)";
