var content = "An unknown elderly person in a dream represents one’s good luck, happiness and one’s assiduity and diligence. If the unknown elderly person looks strong in the dream, he represents one’s strength. Otherwise, if he looks feeble, then he represents one’s weakness. Whatever physical conditions an elderly person is seen with in the dream, such condition will reflect in one’s own state. If an elderly person comes toward the person seeing the dream, it means that someone will help him attain a praiseworthy rank. If one follows an elderly person in a dream, it means that he follows a good path. If one sees an elderly person and displeases him in the dream, it means that he will displease a close friend or reject his advice. If he pleases him in the dream, it means that he will consent with a close good friend and they will walk together on the path to reap material as well as spiritual benefits. If one sees a gathering of friendly people but could not determine whether they are young or elderly in a dream, it means that he will discover new avenues in his life and he will draw material and spiritual benefits from them. If he sees a gathering of young people he does not recognize in the dream, it means that he will associate himself with rich people. If he sees a gathering of elderly people he does not recognize in the dream, it means that he will associate himself with good friends. If a woman sees an elderly person she could not recognize in the dream, he represents the world. If a young man sees himself turned into an elderly person in a dream, it means that he will acquire knowledge and wisdom. Listening to a good looking elderly person in a dream means receiving honor and rank. If an elderly person sees himself turned young in a dream, it represents his strength, wealth, good living and a healthy life, or it could mean material or religious losses, or it could mean his death. If an elderly person sees himself beingborn again in a dream, it means his death. If he is ill, it could represent his attachment to the world, and if he is poor, it could denote his earning. If an elderly person sees himself as a youth in a dream, it could also mean committing a childish act or an unwise act. A wise elderly person in a dream represents honor, rank, dignity, wealth, blessings and longevity. On the other hand, seeing an elderly person in a dream could represents failure, weaknesses, defeat, disablement or inertness. (Also see Gray hair)";
