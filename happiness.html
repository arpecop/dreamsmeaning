var content = "(Elation | Excitement | Joy) In general, happiness in a dream means sorrow. To be happy about something which the heart does not feel comfortable with, or which the heart does not qualify as correct conduct or behavior in a dream means sadness and sorrow in wakefulness. Happiness in a dream also means being indifferent about following God’s commands. If one’s happiness in his dream is derived from the release of a prisoner or the recovery of a sick person, then it means positive changes in one’s life. If one is told something that is supposed to make him happy, when in fact it made him sad in the dream, such as being told in a dream that so and so has just arrived from a long journey, when in fact such person has just died, it means that his sadness will be dispelled and his sorrows removed. Feeling happy in a dream means sadness, sorrow, or crying. If one sees his friends happy in a dream, then it means happiness for him too.";
