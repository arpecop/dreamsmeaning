var content = "(Bosom | Heart) If one has a broad and a nice looking chest in a dream, it means repentance of a sinner or being eager and willing to follow the truth and to comply with it, or it could mean making it easy to accept things that were difficult to absorb. If a woman sees her beloved inside her chest in a dream, it means that she is suffering because of him or complaining about him, or if she is ill, it means that she will recover from her illness. To have a broad chest in a dream also means giving preference to others’ needs. One’s chest in a dream also represents what one may conceal in it of knowledge, guidance, heedlessness or it could represent a coffer where one hides his money. One’s chest in a dream also represents a guest, one’s wife, a rank, a position, magnanimity or gener- osity. The narrowness of one’s chest in a dream represents heedlessness, or it could mean going astray, loss of money, or one’s stinginess. If one sees his chest turned into a stone in a dream, it means that he is a hard hearted person. However, a broad chest in a dream also could signify being unjust. The chest in a dream also represents the house of worries and anxieties. Having chest pain in a dream denotes a sin one is being punished for, or it could mean being a spendthrift or generous in other than God’s pleasure, and the pain in the dream represents his punishment for it. If a man sees himself having a woman’s breasts in his dream, it means that he will get married, or fall in love with a woman, or have a secret affair that will turn into a scandal. (Also see Body’)";
