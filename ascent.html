var content = "(Incline | Mountain road | Steep incline) If one sees himself climbing a steep incline in a dream, it means toiling to succeed in both his material and spiritual life, or it could mean trying to gather the benefits of both worlds, though with great strain on him . An ascent in a dream also could signify a difficult woman or a stern man who can only be handled with kindness, gentleness and love. An ascent in a dream also represents one’s associate, or a business partner who cannot be trusted with one’s money or life. An ascent in a dream also represents the road to salvation or the dangers one may have to cross and the deeds that can save him from hell-fire. An ascent in a dream also could represent adversities, difficulties and dangers. Ascending a steep incline in a dream means danger and descending a steep hill means reaching safety. An ascent in a dream also could represent a bridge, an underpass, a wife, a woman, or a scorpion. Walking through a steep incline in a dream also means rising in station because of one’s knowledge, politics, good conduct, fulfillment of one’s duties, his caring for others or wisdom. Falling through a steep hill in a dream means falling in rank, losing one’s prestige, losing one’s money, denying the truth, objecting to one’s religion or walking into darkness. Climbing in a dream always means attainment of one’s goals. Climbing flat on one’s back in a dream has negative connotations. Descending from a steep hill, or from a ship, or coming down form a castle or a mountain in a dream also mean that one’s goal will not materialize. (Also see Ascending the skies | Climbing a mountain)";
