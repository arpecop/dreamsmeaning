var content = "(Couch | Mattress | Sleeping pad) Abed without covers in a dream represents travels, a wife, honor or a high rank. Sitting on abed in a dream means regaining power or authority over something one had lost control. If the bed has it covers on, then it means ruling over a group of hypocrites who live in heedlessness. If it is not covered, then it means a journey. If one sees himself wearing his shoes and sitting on his bed in a dream, it means that he will undertake a trip in the company of an ostentatious person. Sitting on a bed in a pleasant surrounding in a dream means honor and power. The covers of one’s bed in a dream represent his wife, his livelihood, or his mistress. Whatever stands on top of a bed represents one’s male children and whatever is hidden under it represents one’s female children. A bed in a dream also represents happiness, joy and dignity. It may also represent a wife, a ship, or a coffin. If one’s bed falls apart or breaks into pieces in a dream, it means loss of authority, dismissal from one’s job, divorcing one’s wife, or it could mean her death. If one sees himself sitting over an unknown bed in a dream, it means marriage or conceiving a child. Sitting over a bed without a mattress means death, or a business trip. If a woman sees herself bringing a bed into her house in a dream, it means that she will get married. If a sick person sees himself sitting up in his bed in a dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. (Also see Couch | Mattress)";
