var content = "A fountainhead in a dream represents blessings, grace, bounty and attaining one’s goal. If one sees many springs gushingforth inside his own house in a dream, and if he is not a discrete person, it represents a calamity that will bringhim and his family to their knees with sorrow and tears. If one sees himself taking a ritual ablution for prayers from a fountainhead in a dream, it means that he will receive lawful money. Discovering a fountainhead in a dream means prosperity. If the spring gushes forth inside one’s house or from the walls of one’s house in the dream, then it means a calamity or a misfortune that will be caused by a woman, a brother or a brother in-law. If the water flows into the street in a dream, it means that such a calamity or adversity will leave that house and peace will finally prevail. If the water is pure and clean in the dream, it means depression along with a strong and a healthy body. What is disliked in such dreams is the murky water. If one owns a stream in a dream, it represents one’s livelihood, his shop, business, work, or one’s good deeds that remain beneficial even after his death and until the Day of Judgment such as a blessed progeny, a school or a mosque he builds, a road he opens, a book of knowledge he leaves behind, or a charitable endowment. Seeing waters overflowing from a fountainhead and flooding one’s property means sadness, crying and sorrow and the same applies if one drinks from that water in his dream. If one sees several springs gushing forth in a dream, it means prospering through dirty actions and corruption. Seeing a spring in the valley in a dream means blessings for most people and particularly for the sick and the needy. A dried well in a dream means the opposite. If one who is suffering from depression sees a spring in his dream, it means relief from his difficulties, repayment of his debts, recovering from his illness, or repentance from his sins. A spring of sweet water in a dream also means collecting one’s profits or rents. If one sees a rivulet carrying pure and sweet water to his house in a dream, it means profits, easy life and blessings that will be driven to him. (Also see Rivulet | Spring)";
