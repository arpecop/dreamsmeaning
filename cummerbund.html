var content = "(Belt | Cincture | Sash | Waistband) In a dream, the broad band worn around the waist, also known as a sash or a cummerbund represents one’s father, mother or paternal uncle. Tying a cummerbund around one’s waist in a dream means that one has exhausted half of his life. Owning many cummer- bunds in a dream means longevity. A cummerbund in a dream also represents one’s son or it could denote a big man. If a ruler offers a cummerbund to someone in a dream, it means that he is appointing him to a high ranking position. Wearing a cummerbund without ornaments in a dream means that one will receive the help of a great and a noble person, including moral and financial support. If one is rich, then it means that he will have a great friend to support him and whose inner thoughts and intentions are better than what one may think. If a poor person ties a cummerbund around his waist in a dream, it means extra earnings or power. If the cummerbund is studded and adorned with jewels in the dream, then such jewels represent one’s helpers, supporters or obedient subjects. Such associates will carry on his commands whether they purport good or evil. Somehow, such a leader will also be unjust and hypocritical. If the ornaments are made of iron in the dream, it means that his associates are a group of strong people. If the ornaments are made from copper, then such associates care only for worldly gains. If the ornaments are made from led in the dream, it means that they are weak people. If the ornaments are made from silver in the dream, it means that the master or leader is a wealthy person and he will be followed by a strong son who will carry the work of his father. If one is given a cummerbund, and if he does not wear it in the dream, then it means travels. A broken cummerbund in a dream means loss of power or perhaps one’s death. If one sees a snake rather than a cummerbund around his waist in a dream, it represents a money belt. A cummerbund in a dream also means work for a jobless person, a wife for an unmarried person, and should it be carrying many ornaments, then it means the added blessing of having several children.
