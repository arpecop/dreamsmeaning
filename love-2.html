var content = "(Beloved | Enamored | Honey | Hostage | Lover | Platonic love) Love in a dream means trials and temptations. If one does something he loves in a dream, it means that he will engage in an act that has no limitations. If a man says to woman – “I love you,” in a dream, it means that he truly hates her. If one sees himself indulging and satisfying every desire he has and without feeling any restrictions in the dream, it means that he will stray from God’s path and lives a corrupt life. Love in a dream also means distress, worries and sorrow. Love in a dream also represents one’s ability to express something. Otherwise, it could mean that he keeps to himself. Love in a dream also means trials and fame that incurs people’s compassion for the person in love. Love in a dream also means poverty, sickness and death. In fact, death in a dream also could mean love, or living distant from one’s beloved or life after death. To burn in the fire in a dream also means love. To enter paradise in a dream also means love and to enter hell-fire in a dream means separation from one’s beloved. Yearning for one’s beloved in a dream means heedlessness, and love in a dream also indicates corruption in one’s religious life, or loss of money. To love someone in God in a dream, means mercy between people. Otherwise, to love one another for personal interests in a dream means a partnership that will end in betrayal or it could mean a marriage without family consent. Pretending to be in love in one’s dream means straying from God’s path. If a knowledgeable person or a scholar pretends to be enamored in a dream, it means that he will deceive people with his ornate presentations and contradict their standards. (Also see Enam- ored | Honey | Lick | Pretending)Asalam o alekum 
Today I dreamt about the girl i love, she was crying just because she was sure if i love her too. As I hugged her after sometime she started crying and i whispered into her ears m i love you’ and she responded back i love you too.. Can you just explain me the meaning of this dream. I truly love her and I don’t want to lose her";
