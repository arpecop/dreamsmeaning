var content = "(Hearth | Stove) An iron cast stove or a fireplace in a dream represents a woman who comes from a powerful and a strong family. If the stove or the fireplace is made from yellow copper or brass in the dream, then such a woman may have come from a house of a worldly and rich people. A wooden fireplace in a dream represents hypocrisy in such a family. If the fireplace is made of plaster in the dream, it means that such a family has associated itself with Pharaonic traditions or worship. If the fireplace is made of argillite or form sun- dried bricks in the dream, it means that someone in that family is a godly and a pious person. A fireplace in a dream also represents a state, a government, joblessness or fleeing from one’s enemy. If the fireplace or the stove is lit with no food to cook or water to boil over it in the dream, it means that the head of the household, the butler or the house keeper will become angry and infuriated by someone’s slander or backbiting. If the cooking pot in the dream is interpreted to represent the wife, then the fireplace would represent her husband who faces the adversities and hardships of life. On the other hand, if the fireplace in the dream is interpreted to represent the wife, then the cooking pot would be her husband who is always sitting on fire. If the fireplace or the stove is not lit in the dream, then it represents distress, worries and trouble, but if it is on, then it means fulfilling one’s needs and earning one’s livelihood through hard work. A fireplace in a dream also represents one’s wife, his tools and instruments, his vehicle, or it could represent a place of gathering, one’s rank, a chair, light, a woman in childbed, a father, a mother, a pregnant woman, one’s shop or a helper. A fireplace in a dream also could represent the month of January or the cold season. If a bachelor sees a fireplace in a dream, it means that he will get married, and if he is married, it means that his wife will become pregnant. If he is a sinner, it means that he will repent for his sins, for a fireplace is the abode of fire and fire in a dream represents fear, horror and guidance. A fireplace in a dream also represents one’s stomach and the firewood in a dream represents a late heavy meal that will cause indigestion or confused dreams. (Also see Brazier | Firewood)";
