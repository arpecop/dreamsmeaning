var content = "(Astray | Injustice | Kill | Murder | Relief) In a dream, slaughter means displeasing one’s parents, or it could mean injustice. If one sees himself in a dream slaughtered, he should pray hard and seek refuge in God Almighty to help him. If one sees corpses of slaughtered people scattered around him in a dream, it means profits and achievement of his goals. Seeing slaughtered people in a dream also may mean that they have gone astray. If one sees a man or a butcher slaughtering him in a dream, it means that he will triumph over his assailant. If he is imprisoned, it means that he will be set free. If he is seized by fear, it means that he will reach safety and regain his equanimity and peacefulness. If he is a war captured prisoner, it means that he will be set free. If he is a leader, it means that his sovereignty will widen. Slaughtering someone in a dream means being unjust toward him. Slaughtering a pigeon in a dream means getting married. Cutting a piece of flesh from one’s backside in a dream means that he engages in sodomy. If one finds himself slaughtered but does not know who killed him in the dream, it means that he is an innovator, or it could mean that he will forge a testimony. Murdering one’s own father or mother in a dream means disobeying them or assaulting them and becoming damned. To slaughter a woman in a dream means adultery, or eliciting sexual intercourse with her. To slaughter a fowl or the female of any bird or animal in dream means deflowering a young girl. To slaughter a son in a dream means that such a son is ruthless and unjust toward his parents. If one kills himself in a dream, it means that he married a woman who is unlawful to him. (Also see Slaughter house)";
