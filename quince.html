var content = "(Fruit) A quince in a dream denotes a sickness. However, if a sick person eats this fruit in his dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. If a governor eats quince in his dream, it means that he will achieve his goals. If a healthy person eats it in his dream, it means that he will receive spiritual guidance. If a merchant eats it in his dream, it means prosperity. Extracting juice from a quince in a dream means undertaking a business trip and reaping good benefits from one’s venture. A quince tree in a dream represents a prudent, discrete and a firm man from whom no one can benefit, or it could represent a vile person. A green quince in a dream is better than a yellow one. A quince in a dream also represents a beautiful and a noble woman. Many interpreters disliked the quince fruit because of its yellowish color, and they mostly qualify it to mean sickness because of the constipation it causes if eaten raw. However, its yellowish color also can be interpreted as the color of gold. Seeing or eating a quince in a dream also means travelling with good companions, though some of them may be of no benefit. However, in general a quince or a quince tree in a dream can still be interpreted in a positive sense under all circumstances.";
