var content = "(zool. ) In a dream, a hoopoe represents a truthful messenger, an intimate person, a spy, an arguing scholar, escape from adversities and sufferings, or leveling a building. A hoopoe in a dream also represents one who knows God Almighty and understands the value of the Divine Laws. If a thirsty person sees a hoopoe in his dream, it means that he will find water. A hoopoe in a dream also represents a great scholar who is constantly barraged with accusations and blame because of the bird’s offensive smell. Seeing a hoopoe in a dream also means profits, honor and wealth. Eating a hoopoe in a dream means receiving news from the governor, or hosting a traveller. A hoopoe in a dream also represents the king’s advisor, the court’s seer, an astrologer, a writer, a scribe, or a critic. Holding a hoopoe in one’s hand in a dream means glad tidings, or profits from a business in another market or town. Owning a hoopoe in a dream means having influence over someone in authority, or it could represent a writer, or a perspicacious person but who has no religious commitment. Slaugh- tering a hoopoe in a dream means getting hold of such person. Owning a female hoopoe in a dream means getting married. Slaughtering a female hoopoe in a dream means deflowering a young girl.";
