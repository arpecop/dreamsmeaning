var content = "A glass bottle in a dream represents a servant, a housekeeper, a son or a woman. A glass bottle in a dream also represents a woman who does not keep a secret, a slanderous companion, sickness, an adulteress or a prostitute. A glass bottle filled with oil in a dream represents a woman and her makeup. If one grooms his hair with oil from such a bottle in a dream, it means adorning himself or being proud about his love for such a woman. If the oil spills over one’s face during the process of applying it in the dream, it means that he will suffer from distress. The broken chips of a glass bottle in a dream represent money. A urine testing tube in a dream represents a prostitute. Thus, if one sees himself urinating inside such a tube in his dream, he should beware not to commit adultery. A bottle of wine in a dream represents a housekeeper who is hesitant about carrying money on her. A bottle of wine in a dream represents a pregnant woman who could suffer from hemorrhaging though she will deliver her child safely. Glass bottles of different colors and sizes in a dream represent people of different nationalities. A glass bottle in a dream also could mean exposing people’s secret life or slandering disloyal people. If a glass bottle falls and breaks inside one’s house in a dream, it means avoiding corruption or escaping from temptation that could take place inside such a house. (Also see Bottle)";
