var content = "(Display | Hearing | Honor guards | Inspection of troops | Military re- view | Portrayal | Presentation | Review officer | Show) If one sees himself standing before a high-ranking officer during a ceremony of reviewing the guards of honor or in a military barrack in a dream, and if the officer is displeased with him in the dream, it means that he will commit a major sin. If one thinks that the officer is pleased with him in the dream, then it implies God’s blessings. The high- ranking officer or the review officer in such a dream also represents a com- passionate person who cares, and who frequently asks about his friends, helps them solve their problems, and assists them in every possible way. (Also see Hearing board | Inquisitional court)";
