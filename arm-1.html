var content = "(Forearm | Limb | Member | Wing) One’s two arms in a dream represent his two brothers, his two close friends, two sons or partners. If one sees a person with short arms in a dream, it means that he is courageous, generous and wondrous. One’s arm in a dream represent his brother and supporter or a spiritual example he follows. If one’s arm is broken in a dream, it means the death of one’s brother or closest friend, or it could mean an accident or a calamity. One’s arm in a dream also signifies protection from sin or it cold represent his wife, his mother, his teacher, wealth, craft, source of income, a supporting son or a close brother one can depend on at times of difficulties. If one sees that his arm is missing something in a dream, it could mean that he has little brain, though he is filled with pride and haughtiness. (Also see Air | Body’ | Forearm)I had a very creepy dream where I grabbed my baby by his arm and when I got him close to me his arm was mangled and distorted. ..I looked at it again and then the structure was fine but it was cut open on the inside of the forearm and hollowed out…then I get to the hospital and it’s fine and I say something like I must be hallucinating I guess um crazy…any ideas what that might mean?";
