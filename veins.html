var content = "(Blood ties | Family | Relative | Vessel) The veins of the children of Adam represent their tribal belonging or clan. The parable of one’s veins is like that of a tree and its branches. One’s veins in a dream represent his family members, depending which part of the body they belong to. The condition and beauty of one’s veins in a dream denote their counterpart in one’s family. If one sees his vein split open in a dream, it means the death of a relative. The same dream also could denote deceit, evil, an accident or a calamity. Otherwise, it could represent a divided family. Exposed veins in a dream mean difficulties. The point of pulsation in one’s veins or the arteries, or the veins of the carpal tunnel in a dream represent one’s livelihood, job, income, or the elderly people of his family. If a rich person sees a specific quantity of blood running through his veins in a dream, it means that he will lose an equal portion or percentage of his money. Otherwise, if a poor person sees that dream, it means that he will earn an equal amount of money. (Also see Aorta | Blood | Body’ | Jugular vein)";
