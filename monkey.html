var content = "Dreaming of a monkey, denotes that deceitful people will flatter you to advance their own interests. To see a dead monkey, signifies that your worst enemies will soon be removed. If a young woman dreams of a monkey, she should insist on an early marriage, as her lover will suspect unfaithfulness. For a woman Dreaming of feeding a monkey, denotes that she will be betrayed by a flatterer. HI, I had been seeing dreams fighting with cat, dogs and monkeys.  In starting I had dream, fighting with cats and dogs sometime mouse as well and most of the time I defeated and killed them barehanded, by tearing them apart from their mouths.  But whenever I had dream of monkey I was defeated, earlier I used to see one monkey attacking and fighting but later I saw many of monkeys attacking and rather than fighting I was trying to be in safe place or avoid it to save my life.  Although for a long time I don’t have any such dream but what could that mean to me.  ";
