var content = "(Jot down | Scribble | Writing) Writing in a dream signifies a trick, a gimmick or a conspiracy. A writer in a dream represents a cunning and a fraudulent person. If one’s handwriting looks illegible, or inelegant in the dream, it means that he will repent for dishonesty and from defrauding people. Writing on a scroll or on a legal pad in a dream means that one may receive an inheritance. Writing in a notebook in a dream means dodging, or repudiation. Writing a novel or a book in a dream means receiving unlawful money, or it could mean falling sick. If one sees himself writing a book or a letter and finishes it in his dream, it means that he will complete a project and fulfill his goals. If he fails to complete his book or his letter in the dream, it means that something will hamper , or stand in the way of completing his project. Writing with the left hand in a dream means indulging in loathsome actions, going astray, or perhaps having a son who is born from adultery, or it could mean that one may become a poet. Signing a deed, a check or a legal contract in a dream means failing to fulfill an agreement. If one sees someone he knows drafting a contract between them in a dream, it means that the other person will defraud him, mislead him in a business deal and drive him astray. If one finds himself illiterate and incapable of writing in a dream, it means that he is depressed, though God Almighty will show him a way out of his difficulties. If an illiterate person sees himself trying to learn how to write and read in a dream, it means that he will benefit from something he feared for a long time, or it could mean that he will go through hard times. If a learned person finds himself incapable of writing anything in a dream, it means depression, fear, toiling and obstruction of his business. (Also see Book | Letter | Paper | Sign)";
