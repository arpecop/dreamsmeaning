var content = "(Yarn) If a woman sees herself working on a spinning wheel and quickly trying to finish her work in a dream, it means that a traveller will soon come home, or that an expected visitor will arrive. If she sees herself taking her time in spinning her wool in a dream, it means that either she or her husband will undertake a journey. If the thread breaks inside the bobbin in her dream, it means cancellation of her plans to travel. If she sees herself in a dream spinning cotton threads, it means separation from her husband. During such a separation, she will cease asking her husband for her bridal dower, and later on she will return to him. If she sees herself spinning linen in a dream, it means that she will seek the company of righteous people to acquire wisdom and knowledge. If a man sees himself spinning cotton, or linen in a dream, it means that he will suffer humiliation, or he may engage in a job which he cannot do properly. If the threads he is spinning turn thin in the dream, it means that he toils hard through his work but fails to do it properly. If the threads turn too thick in the dream, it means that he will undertake a business trip and reap success from it. If a man sees a woman spinning cotton in her house in a dream, it means that she will betray her husband with someone else. If one sees himself spinning wool, fur, or hair in his dream, it means that he will undertake a profitable business trip. To undo a spun thread in a dream means renouncing one’s allegiance, or breaking one’s promise, or denying one’s commitment. (Also see Ball of thread | Pledge of allegiance | Spindle)";
