var content = "(Bondman | Servant | Submission) If a free man sees himself as a slave, and if he recognizes the person who enslaved him in the dream, it means that he will serve such a person, or perhaps he may blackmail him. Becoming a slave in a dream also means excessive borrowing of money until one becomes a slave to his lenders, or that the compounded interest of his loans weigh heavy on his family, or it could mean reorganization of one’s business, or that he may work for his lender to repay his debts, or it could mean that he may develop heart problems, or any debilitating illness. If one is sold as a slave in a dream, it means that he will regain honor and dignity, or perhaps fall in a trap, for selling a free person in a dream means humiliating him. Selling a human being in a dream also connotes a good end, such as that in the story of God’s prophet Joseph, upon whom be peace. If a bondman sees himself free in a dream, it means that he will experience ease after he was subjugated to difficulties and hardships, or it could mean paying his debts, recovering from an illness, attaining one’s goals, or perhaps he may become a true servant of God Almighty, who commands good and forbids evil, establishes regular prayers, pays his charities and fears wrongdoing. Being a slave in a dream also means distress. Being sold in a dream also means worries, unless if the buyer is a woman, then it means that he will be honored and well treated. His value and comfort then will depend on the price he is sold for in the dream. If an unmarried woman is sold as a slave in a dream, it means that she will marry the one who bought her. If a man sells his wife in a dream, it means that he will divorce her. If one is captured and turned into a slave by his enemy in a dream, it means that he will learn something about humiliation and submissiveness.";
