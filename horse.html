var content = "If you dream of seeing or riding a white horse, the indications are favorable for prosperity and pleasurable commingling with congenial friends and fair women. If the white horse is soiled and lean, your confidence will be betrayed by a jealous friend or a woman. If the horse is black, you will be successful in your fortune, but you will practice deception, and will be guilty of assignations. To a woman, this dream denotes that her husband is unfaithful. Dreaming of dark horses, signifies prosperous conditions, but a large amount of discontent. Fleeting pleasures usually follow this dream. To see yourself riding a fine bay horse, denotes a rise in fortune and gratification of passion. For a woman, it foretells a yielding to importunate advances. She will enjoy material things.

To see a horse running away with others, denotes that you will hear of the illness of friends. To see fine stallions, is a sign of success and high living, and undue passion will master you. To see brood mares, denotes congeniality and absence of jealousy between the married and sweethearts. To ride a horse to ford a stream, you will soon experience some good fortune and will enjoy rich pleasures. If the stream is unsettled or murky, anticipated joys will be somewhat disappointing. To swim on a horse’s back through a clear and beautiful stream of water, your conception of passionate bliss will be swiftly realized. To a business man, this dream portends great gain. To see a wounded horse, foretells the trouble of friends. Dreaming of a dead horse, signifies disappointments of various kinds. Dreaming of riding a horse that bucks, denotes that your desires will be difficult of consummation.

Your fortune will be embarrassed by ill health. Dreaming of catching a horse to bridle and saddle, or harness it, you will see a great improvement in business of all kinds, and people of all callings will prosper. If you fail to catch it, fortune will play you false. To see spotted horses, foretells that various enterprises will bring you profit. Dreaming of having a horse shod, your success is assured. For a woman, this dream omens a good and faithful husband. Dreaming that you shoe a horse, denotes that you will endeavor to and perhaps make doubtful property your own. Dreaming of race horses, denotes that you will be surfeited with fast living, but to the farmer this dream denotes prosperity. Dreaming that you ride a horse in a race, you will be prosperous and enjoy life. Dreaming of killing a horse, you will injure your friends through selfishness. To mount a horse bareback, you will gain wealth and ease by hard struggles. To ride bareback in company with men, you will have honest people to aid you, and your success will be merited. If in company with women, your desires will be loose, and your prosperity will not be so abundant as might be if women did not fill your heart. To curry a horse, your business interests will not be neglected for frivolous pleasures. Dreaming of trimming a horse’s mane, or tail, denotes that you will be a good financier or farmer. Literary people will be painstaking in their work and others will look after their interest with solicitude. Dreaming of horses, you will amass wealth and enjoy life to its fullest extent. To see horses pulling vehicles, denotes wealth with some incumbrance, and love will find obstacles. If you are riding up a hill and the horse falls but you gain the top, you will win fortune, though you will have to struggle against enemies and jealousy. If both the horse and you get to the top, your rise will be phenomenal, but substantial. For a young girl Dreaming that she rides a black horse, denotes that she should be dealt with by wise authority. Some wishes will be gratified at an unexpected time. Black in horses, signifies postponements in anticipations. To see a horse with a tender foot, denotes that some unexpected unpleasantness will insinuate itself into your otherwise propitious state. If you attempt to fit a broken shoe which is too small for the horse’s foot, you will be charged with making fraudulent deals with unsuspecting parties. To ride a horse down hill, your affairs will undoubtedly disappoint you. For a young woman Dreaming that a friend rides behind her on a horse, denotes that she will be foremost in the favors of many prominent and successful men. If she was frightened, she is likely to stir up jealous sensations. If after she alights from the horse it turns into a pig, she will carelessly pass by honorable offers of marriage, preferring freedom until her chances of a desirable marriage are lost. If afterward she sees the pig sliding gracefully along the telegraph wire, she will by intriguing advance her position, For a young woman Dreaming that she is riding a white horse up and down hill, often looking back and seeing some one on a black horse, pursuing her, denotes she will have a mixed season of success and sorow,{sic} but through it all a relentless enemy is working to overshadow her with gloom and disappointment. To see a horse in human flesh, descending on a hammock through the air, and as it nears your house is metamorphosed into a man, and he approaches your door and throws something at you which seems to be rubber but turns into great bees, denotes miscarriage of hopes and useless endeavors to regain lost valuables. To see animals in human flesh, signifies great advancement to the dreamer, and new friends will be made by modest wearing of well-earned honors. If the human flesh appears diseased or freckled, the miscarriage of well-laid plans is denoted. ";
