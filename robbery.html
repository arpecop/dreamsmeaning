var content = "(Burglary | Garding | Possessing) In a dream, a robbery means adultery or usury. If the thief is unknown in the dream, then he represents the Angel of Death. If the thief is known to the owner of the house, it means that he will benefit from his knowledge, his trade, a good word of wisdom, or from someone’s advice. If an unknown thief enters one’s house and steals his washing basin, or his blanket, or a feminine item, or a similar house item in a dream, it may mean the death of one’s wife, or of a woman in his immediate family. If a known thief robs someone of his money in a dream, it means that he slanders him. If it is an unknown old man in the dream, it means that a close friend will backbite him. A robbery in a dream also has positive connotations, except for a swaggerer who lives on betraying others. If one sees himself sneaking up to steal something in a dream, it means that thieves will burglarize his house or business. If one sees himself stealing something in a dream, it means that he will commit adultery or lie. (Also see Thief)";
