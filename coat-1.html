var content = "(Cloak | Garment | Faith | Overcoat | Religion | Spirituality) Wearing a coat in a dream means honor and respect if new. If it is a shabby or a light coat in the dream, then it means failure in one’s proper attendance to his religious duties. A winter coat in a dream represents a poor but vainglorious and boastful person. A coat in a dream is also interpreted as a mean and a profane woman. If a man sees himself wearing a coat, and if it is interpreted to mean a woman in the dream, then it means that one may have committed a sizeable capital to support something that will bring limited benefits. If one loses his coat in a dream, it means that he will be shielded from poverty and boasts about his status in public. A coat in a dream also represents man’s trust, because it is placed over his shoulders and around his neck. If a woman sees a coat in her dream, it means suffering from unkindness on the part of her husband. (Also see Cap | Overcoat)";
