var content = "Usually when a dreamer dreams of bees the main symbol represents work. The bees are known for working hard and putting lots of effort into it. This dream foretells about the fortune you will meet very soon and you will receive the award for something good you did. It is very surprising how in real life bees are something we are afraid of or trying to avoid, but contrary when it comes to dreaming mostly of the time it is a good sign. If in the dream, just like in reality the bee stings you, be aware of someone in your life as you could be tricked or&#x2F;and deceived or already feel the consequences of it, and therefore having these dreams.dreaming bees";
