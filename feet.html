var content = "Dreaming of seeing your own feet, is omnious{sic} of despair. You will be overcome by the will and temper of another. To see others’ feet, denotes that you will maintain your rights in a pleasant, but determined way, and win for yourself a place above the common walks of life. Dreaming that you wash your feet, denotes that you will let others take advantage of you. Dreaming that your feet are hurting you, portends troubles of a humiliating character, as they usually are family quarrels. To see your feet swollen and red, you will make a sudden change in your business by separating from your family. This is an evil dream, as it usually foretells scandal and sensation. ";
