var content = "(Changing form) Transformation by substitution in a dream where one thing is converted into something else. If a withered tree is trans- formed into a blossoming one in a dream, it means political changes, changes in worldly conditions, or reversal of conditions from good to bad, or from bad to good. This element includes the transformation of inner substances or physical ones. For example, if sees himself as an old person in a dream, when in real life he is young, it means progress in his spiritual life and gaining honor. If he is an old person and sees himself as a young boy in a dream, it means indulging in wrongdoing. If one sees a known old person regaining his youth, it means that the material conditions of the person seeing the dream will turn around to one’s advantage or otherwise, i.e., richness into poverty and vice-versa, or if he is sick, he will recover from his illness. If one is transformed into a beautiful shoot of green or a blossoming branch of a tree in a dream, it means that he may die within a short time. Becoming taller in a dream means longevity, prosperity, or begetting a son. If one finds himself missing partial mental keenness or physical abilities or a limb in a dream, it means that he may suffer losses relating to his worldly interests. If a man sees himself transformed into a woman, and wears her apparels, ornaments and make-up in a dream, it means that he may suffer humiliation, adversities and abuse. If a woman sees herself transformed into a man, or if she grows a beard in a dream, it means that she will reestablish her connection with a missing child. As a man in the dream, and if she is pregnant, it means that she will beget a son who may die in his early youth, but if she is not pregnant, it means that she is no longer fertile. If one sees himself flying with wings in a dream, it means travels. If one sees himself transformed into a wooden staff in a dream, it represents his insolence. If one sees himself transformed into an iron rod in a dream, it means longevity. If one sees himself transformed into a bridge in a dream, it means that he may become a ruler, a wise man, or a man of knowledge whom people will seek to benefit from his wisdom. If a person sees his sick child turn into a bird in a dream, it means the death of the child. If one sees himself turned into a beast in a dream, it means that he will be segregated from the believers to live alone because of his evil qualities. If one sees himself turned into a deer, a gazelle or an antelope in a dream, it means that he will become obsessed with his sexual life, or that he will become mentally deranged to the degree of indulging in bisexual practices. If he turns into a pig in a dream, it means prosperity surrounded with absence of human dignity. If one sees a steer transformed into a wolf in a dream, it represents a government employee who will turn unjust. However, according to Islamic interpretations of the human transformation into a lower category of creatures phenomena, if such transformation takes place in real life, it connotes a curse and a punishment, and it does not last for more than three days, and it will culminate in death.
