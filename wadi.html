var content = "(Valley) Seeing a ravine or a valley with a dry watercourse in a dream means going on a tiering trip, taking a longjourney, or it could represent an intractable person. Seeing a wadi in a dream denotes good deeds, or making offerings to please God Almighty. A wadi in a dream also represents its dwellers, a tribe from that region, or its plantations. If one sees the wadi blossoming with fruit trees, fragrant flowers, a running water course, or if one hears nice words during such a dream, it means that he will rise in station, or mingle with people in power, or receive an appointment in the government, and for a righteous person, it means that miraculous events and blessings will be shown at his hands by God’s leave. Seeing a wadi in a dream also means rain, and that the ravine will be filled with rainwater. A wadi in a dream also could represent a prison because of the steep mountains surrounding it and the difficulty in crossing it. Seeing oneself in a wadi floating in the air until one reaches a desired altitude in a dream means working for a powerful person. A wadi in a dream also represents a warrior, a bandit, a highway robber or a lion. If a wadi obstructs one’s journey in a dream, it may represent a robbery, heavy rain, or having to face a dangerous person. If one is not travelling, then it means distress, adversity, harm, imprisonment, fear, or illness. Crossing a wadi in the wintertime in a dream means escaping from danger. Digging a wadi in a dream means the death of a family member. Falling into a steep wadi in a dream and feeling no pain or incurring no harm from it in a dream means that one will receive a gift from someone in authority or from his superior. Inhabiting a valley with no vegetation in a dream means performing one’s pilgrimage to Mecca. To wander aimlessly in a wadi in a dream means writing a poem. (Also see Flying)";
