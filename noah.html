var content = "(God’s prophet Noah, upon whom be peace.) In a dream, God’s prophet Noah (uwbp) represents longevity, adversities, sufferings, triumph, children from a disgraceful wife, though one will remain content and grateful to God Almighty for His gift. It is said that one who sees the prophet Noah (uwbp) in a dream will become a scholar, an assiduous worshipper and an obedient servant who exercises patience and forbearance. He will also triumph over his enemies and receive a magnificent endowment from his Lord. His companions will disobey him and by God’s leave, he will win over them too. Seeing God’s prophet Noah (uwbp) in a dream also means rain and floods. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also means suffering from many enemies, and from the jealousy and envy of one’s neighbors. At the end, they will all suffer from God’s punishment, and he will be saved from their evil. Seeing God’s prophet Noah (uwbp) in a dream also signifies the destruction of the unbelievers and the victory of the believers. If one sees him in a ship in a dream, it means that such a ship will escape from destruction, or that all its people will be saved from drowning. Seeing God’s prophet Noah (uwbp) in a dream also means facing a strong army of unbelievers, their blatant attitudes, their verbal and physical abuse of the believers, and their unrestrained persecution of the physically weak among them. It also denotes the weakness of people’s faith and their lack of trust in God Almighty. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also means spending a lifetime in devotion and servitude to one’s Lord, commanding good and forbidding evil. If a ruler sees God’s prophet Noah (uwbp) in a dream, it means that his subject will disobey him. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also means crying and lamentation, disputes with one’s family, rising prices, relief from distress, adversities and having recalcitrant children. Seeing him in a dream also represents a flourishing business, farming, a ship building industry, travelling with several types of food, or mixing different species of animals. God’s prophet Noah (uwbp) in a dream also may represent a genealogist, a zoologist, a botanist, a phytologist, a horticulturalist, an ecologist, or a mammalogist. Seeing God’s prophet Noah (uwbp) in a dream also may mean regretting something, distress, penitence for an attitude toward one’s own family, or perhaps that one’s son will stray away from God’s path, or it could mean the death of a son because of his disobedience to his father. If a woman sees God’s prophet Noah (uwbp), or God’s prophet Lot (uwbp) in a dream, it means that she is disobedient to her husband, and rather she obeys her own family and clan. On the other hand, if a woman sees Egypt’s Pharaoh in a dream, it means that she is a true worshiper and an obedient believer in God Almighty.";
