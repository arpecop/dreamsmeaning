var content = "(Cage | Clothing | House | Luck | Robe) In a dream, dwellings are man’s abode or his world. One’s dwellings in a dream are a reflection of his deeds in wakefulness. If one finds himself in a newly built house which is freshly painted and has all the needed amenities and comforts in a dream, it means prosperity. If he is a poor person, then it means that he will meet his financial obligations with ease. If he is under stress, it means that he will become free from such burdens. If he is a craftsman, it means that he will master his craft or acquire authority equal in dominance to the beauty and perfection, size and details of such a dwelling he saw in the dream. If he is in sin, it means that he will repent. The spaciousness or tightness of one’s dwellings in a dream represents his finances, knowledge, sharing, hospitality and generosity. If one’s own dwellings looked renovated in a dream, it means regaining or developing one’s business for the better. Its fresh paint means fulfilling one’s religious commitments. Its tiles or marble floors represent his pleasures or wife. Dwellings of solid iron cast means longevity and authority. If one enters an unknown house and finds departed souls dwelling therein in a dream, it means that he has entered the realms of the hereafter. If such dwellings are built of mud or plaster, this will be a reflection on his adverse conditions. If one enters such dwellings, then walks out of it in a dream, it means that he will become sick and nearly die of his illness before he recovers from it. If one walks out of it angry in a dream, it means that he will be imprisoned. If he sees someone entering his house in a dream, it means that someone will know his intimate life, or that an insolent person will become a close family friend, then betray his trust and have a secret affairs with one’s wife. If one sees his dwellings crumbling or caving in on him in a dream, it means that he will receive an inheritance from the belongings of a deceased relative. Building a dwelling for oneself or for others in a dream means the death of a relative or of one’s child, or it could mean divorcing one’s wife. Dwellings in a dream also represent a transient station. If the dwelling is built from an unsuitable construction material in the dream, it means that one’s source of income is unlawful. One’s dwellings in a dream also represent his physical form, carnal self and substance. Demolishing a new home in a dream means evil and adversities. (Also see Cage | Glass house | House)";
