var content = "(Goldsmith | Leather craftsman | or any craft using a hammer and a chisel.) An engraver in a dream represents knowledge and pursuit of the prophetic traditions. In a dream, an engraver also means deception, trickery and imposing credulity upon others through dishonesty. A stone carver in a dream represents someone who deals with people of ignorance. A copper engraver represents disputes and illness. Gold and silver engraver in a dream represents clear wisdom and putting things where they belong. An engraver in a dream also represents a worldly person. If he also deals with fabrics in the dream, it means that he is a peacemaker. Seeing him also means spending one’s money to serve evil people or investing money in their projects, lies, falsehood and hypocrisy. The customers in the dream represent people who prefer worldly and temporary benefits over the eternal reward and benefits of the hereafter. If the engraver sells the merchandise but does not accept money for them in the dream, it means that he prefers his spiritual life over his temporary material pleasure and that he is grateful to God Almighty. If he asks for a price for his services, then it means the opposite. If the engraver barters what he sells for wheat or flour in the dream, it means that he will become detached from worldly interests, and that he is grateful for his Lord’s blessings. An engraver in a dream also represents a person who teaches arts and science.";
