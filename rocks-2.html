var content = "(Stone) Mountain rocks in a dream represent strong believers who hold fast to their religious duties. If one sees himself trying to lift a heavy rock, testing his strength in a dream, it means that he will face a strong opponent. If he succeeds at lifting it in the dream, it means that he will win his battle. Otherwise, it could mean that he will lose it. If one sees stones hitting him, or falling over his head in a dream, it means that his superior will delegate heavy responsibilities to him, compel him to do a personal favor, depend on him or impose a service on him. In this case, it means that one’s advice will have effect and his opinion will be respected. Throwing stones in every direction from a high altitude in a dream means being unjust toward others, or it could mean being in a position of strength. If one sees women throwing stones at him using a slingshot in a dream, it means sorcery and a bad spell. If a poor person sees himself hitting a rock with a staff to split it, and suddenly water gushes forth from it in the dream, it means that he will become rich. A rock in a dream also represents hard working women who are patient and bearing their sufferings with determination. A rock in a dream also means longevity, construction, forgetfulness, cattle, impudence, shamelessness, fornication, a dissolute life, immorality, or heartlessness. Seeing a town scattered with rocks in a dream also could mean lower prices. If a rock is interpreted as a rank, then it means a lasting one. If it denotes one’s wife, then it means that she is patient and content. A rock in a dream also represents a threshold, a house, or a statue. Seeing a mountain of rocks in a dream represents heartless, brutal and cruel men, or it could denote their dwellings. If one sees himself drilling a hole into a rock in a dream, it means that he is searching for something hard to get, though he will be able to reach as far as he reaches through drilling in his dream. Descending upon a rock in a dream is interpreted the same as descending upon a mountain in a dream. Rocks in a dream are also interpreted to mean dead people, heedlessness, ignorance, or immorality.
