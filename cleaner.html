var content = "In a dream, a floor cleaner represents someone who investigates people’s conditions and likes to help them. Cleaning throughout a farmland in a dream means seeking the company of righteous people. Cleaning through a vineyard in a dream means investigating the living condition of a woman. Cleaning a tree in a dream means investigating the living conditions of religious people. Sweeping a street in a dream means travelling an equal distance to such a street. If one sees himself cleaning the road to Mecca in a dream, it means that he will perform a pilgrimage. Cleaning through a grass field without knowing the owner in a dream means becoming a renunciate. Cleaning the floors of someone’s house in a dream means finding how he is doing. (Also see Sweeping the floor | Washer | Washing)I had this dream, my own clothes on the washing line and it was clean please explain";
