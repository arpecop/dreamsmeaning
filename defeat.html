var content = "If a believer sees himself defeated in a dream, it means that he will wear the helmet of a warrior and win the battle against his enemy. If one sees himself defeated and shows no fear in the dream, it means his death. If one sees soldiers retreating into a city to take shelter therein in a dream, it means that they will ultimately win their war, even if their cause is unjust or if they represented a tyrant, though they will ultimately have to pay for their crimes. If one sees the soldiers of a just ruler entering a city defeated in a dream, it means that they will surely be victorious over their enemy. (Also see Losing a fight)";
