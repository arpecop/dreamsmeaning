var content = "(Day of Reckoning | Day of Resurrection | Last Day | Reckoning | Rising of the dead | Trumpet of Resurrection) Seeing the Day of Resurrection, or Doomsday in a dream is a serious warning for a sinner, or it could represent a warning for someone who is contemplating a sinful act. Seeing the Day of Resurrection in a dream also denotes justice. Being the only person resurrected on such a day means one’s death. Standing up awaiting one’s judgement on the Day of Resurrection in a dream means travels. If one sees himself and his wife being the only people who are brought for judgement of the grand Day of Gathering in a dream, it means that he is being unjust. If a warrior sees the Day of Resurrection in a dream, it means that by God’s decree, the aggressor shall be defeated. The land of the grand gathering in a dream represents a chaste woman or a noble man. The blowing of the Trumpet of Resurrection in a dream represents the salvation of the righteous ones. Seeing any of the great ex- traordinary events or signs that shall precede the Day of resurrection in a dream means glad tidings for a believer who does good, and a warning for a disbeliever to correct himself and repent for his sins before its coming. Seeing the Day of Resurrection in a dream also denotes that some of the major signs are actually taking place, such as blood shedding, spread of evil, belligerence of atheism, pride about wealth, ruling of the working class, building high rises, the end of the era of kings on earth, or it could remind the person of the prophesied signs, such as the rising of the sun from the West, the emergence of a beast that will speak with a human tongue, the rising of the Imposter (arb. Dajjal. Antichrist), etcetera. Seeing the Day of Resurrection in a dream also represents the spread of evil, the presence of an extended police force, and the ruling of large armies and dictatorships around the world. Thus, seeing the Day of Resurrection in a dream is a reminder and a warning to the one who sees it. If one sees the graves splitting open, dead people resurrected back to life and are walking out of them accompanied with their angels in a dream, it means that justice will prevail in that land. If one experiences the resurrection in a dream, then discovers that the world went back to continue its prior course , it means that justice will dominate that land for a while, then it will be followed by a tyranny that will be carried by people who are not even suspected to be of such character. Such a dream also could be interpreted to suit a person who is seeking the impossible, or one who is adamant at pursuing the path of wrongdoing, falsehood and lies. Recognizing the eminent final signs of the Day of Reckoning in a dream means that one is unaware of his heedlessness and such dream constitutes a warning. If one’s reckoning is easy in a dream, it denotes his wife’s piety, compassion and love for him. If one’s reckoning is detailed and painful in a dream, then it represents major losses. If one’s good deeds weigh heavier than his bad deeds in the dream, it means that his devotion is true and that his reward will be greater. If one sees himself carrying the scale to weigh his own deeds in a dream, it denotes his righteousness and correctness. If one sees an angel handing him his records and telling him to read his own book in the dream, it also means that he is on the right path. Walking on the bridge of the Day of Judgment, carrying one’s own records and crying in a dream means that one is praying for God’s forgiveness and to ease his reckoning. If one sees the Doomsday in a dream, it means that he will escape from dangerous enemies, or that perhaps a major trial will befall the dwellers of that place. If one crosses the Bridge of Judgement in a dream, it means that he will escape a major trial, or perhaps it could represent a major hurdle one may have to cross in this life. If one sees himself carrying his book of records in his right hand in a dream, it means that he will win righteousness, wealth and honor. If one sees himself carrying his book of records in his left hand in a dream, it means that he will fall into sin and the consequent poverty and need of others, for wealth and adultery do not mix. If one witnesses the emergence of the Imposter (Antichrist) in a dream, it signifies new trends, innovations and masses straying from the straight path.
