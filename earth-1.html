var content = "(Element of earth | Dirt) In a dream, earth represents people, for they are created from the same element. Earth in a dream also means cattle, animals or the world. Dirt in a dream represents money, but it could also mean poverty. Digging the earth in a dream means digging a grave for a sick person. Digging the earth in a dream also means a journey, and its collected dirt means profits from one’s journey. If digging the earth is interpreted as seeking marriage, then the earth itself represents one’s future wife. Generally speaking, digging the earth in a dream is bad, because it unveils what is hidden. The dirt itself represents woman’s property. To shake the dust off one’s hands in a dream means business losses, poverty and humiliation. It also means remitting savings to their rightful owners. Walking on dirt means soliciting money. Collecting dirt means saving money. Sweeping dirt in one’s house means to swindle money from one’s wife. Earth also represents mans longevity. If one sees his wife carrying a bag of dirt in a dream, it means a suspicious pregnancy. Earth in a dream also represents the four elements fire, water, air and either, for it is one of the main elements in nature. Wiping one’s face with dirt in a dream means praising others or disappointing oneself. Earth in a dream also means satisfaction of one’s needs or fulfillment of a promise, because ink is extracted from its elements. If a merchant sees his merchandise covered with dirt in a dream, it means depression and unsalability of his merchandise.";
