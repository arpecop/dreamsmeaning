var content = "Having an illness in a dream represents a sickening character, or a hypocrite. Finding oneself ill in a dream means enjoying a good health for that year, or it could mean loss of devotion and lack of piety. If a warrior finds himself sick in a dream, it means that he will be wounded. If one sees his wife sick in a dream, it means that she is negligent of her religious obligations. If a sick person sees himself riding an ox, or a swine in a dream, it means his death. A feverish illness in a dream means pressure caused by a ruler. Feeling sick, or feeling down with an undiagnosed illness in a dream means spending money, or wasting it in ways other than on God’s path. In a dream, illness mostly denotes religious disobedience and religious disdain. If one’s sick child recovers from an illness in a dream, it means his death. If one sees the entire city suffering from an illness in a dream, it means a war, or a siege. If one sees himself ill in a dream, it also means victory over his enemy and enjoying a happy life. Otherwise, seeing anyone suffering from an illness in a dream means lack of work, and for a rich person it means becoming needy. If a business traveller sees himself ill and desiring something in his dream, it means that his business deal will not fall through, for physicians mostly do not grant their patients their wishes. If a bedridden person sees himself freeing a slave from bondage in a dream, it means his death, for a dead person has no property. Seeing a friend sick in a dream means that one will suffer from the same illness. Illness in a dream also signifies spending money, repentance, prayers, supplications, im- ploring, while falling in love in a dream means a sickness. Seeing two of one’s children sick in a dream means that one may suffer from trachoma or ophthalmia, for one’s eyes in a dream represent his children. Illness in a dream means that one has lost something to his adversary. Seeing one’s father ill in a dream means having a migraine headache, for one’s father in a dreams also represents his head. An illness in a dream also signifies falsehood and corruption. If one sees himself suffering from a terminal illness in a dream, it means that his sins will be forgiven, and he will die with God Almighty pleased with him. An illness in a dream also signifies a calamity, distress, fear of something, desiring something, or trouble. The illness of a woman in a dream represents her step daughters from her husband. Man’s sickness in a dream also could signify abstaining from sexual course with his wife during her menstrual period. The illness of scholars means weakness in their religious adherence. The sickness of a ruler means religious failure, or that he may die in that same year. The illness of a teacher in a dream means separation from his students. The illness of a child in a dream means distress and worries for his parents. The death of a suffering old person, or someone with a terminal illness in a dream means relief. The death of an animal in a dream means lack of benefits. A plague in a dream means drought, or prosperity for physicians as well as for undertakers. Complaining about some pain in a dream means distress, unless if the one complaining in the dream is an opponent, then it means victory and joy for the person seeing the dream. (Also see Thief)Slmz 
I recently dreamt that I was diagnosed with lung cancer. I was outwardly scared about the news but inwardly somewhat happy about it. I remember seeing my parents in the dream, scared and worried about my health. The dream did not scare me in any way, but for some reason it’s been on my mind ever since I had it. Is there any Islamic meaning&#x2F;significance to my dream? Thank you ";
