var content = "(Cable | Hawser) In a dream, a rope represents an agreement, a promise, or a covenant. A rope which is extended down from the heavens in a dream represents God’s Book. However, a rope in a dre am also represents rank, respect and prosperity, or it could mean deception, misleading others, or sorcery. Holding to a rope in one’s dream represents one’s strict adherence to God’s path. If the rope is made from fibers in the dream, it means that the one holding it is a rough person. If it is made from leather in the dream, then it represents a bloody person. If the rope is made from wool in the dream, then it represents a religious person. Twisting a rope in a dream means going on a trip. Twisting it around one’s own neck in the dream means getting married. Throwing it over one’s shoulders in the dream means an important appointment resulting from a business trip. Twisting one’s beard to make a rope out of it in a dream means perjury, receiving a bribe and giving a false testimony. Twisting a rope, making one, or measuring it in a dream means travels. Attaching a rope to a wooden stick or a staff in a dream means indulging in an evil act, or engaging in sorcery. (Also see Cable)";
