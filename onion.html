var content = "Eating a raw onion in a dream denotes an evil happening. If a sick person eats a small amount of onions in a dream, it means that he will die from his illness, but if one sees himself eating a large quantity in his dream, it means that he will be cured of his illness. However, eating a green onion, or a scallion in a dream means prosperity and good health, though they will be accompanied with stress, sadness or separation from one’s wife. Eating a strong smelling or a fragrant herb in a dream means contempt, loathing on the part of some members of his family toward him, or it could mean that hidden matters will finally surface. If such herbs are the type of bulbs that require skinning before eating, then they denote curiosity and eavesdropping, representing what is usually discarded. In a dream, onions for a businessman represent the element of money, and for a traveller it represents health, success and a safe return. Onions in a dream also mean distress and difficulties. Gathering onions in the field in a dream means suffering from harm caused by one’s own family.";
