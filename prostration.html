var content = "(Faith | Prayers | Gratitude | Piety | Fear of wrongdoing | Repentance | Reward | Strength | Truthfulness) If one sees himself prostrating in submission to God Almighty in a dream, it means that he will be cured of arrogance, and he will establish the correct spiritual and religious life, quickly achieve what his heart desires in both spiritual and material gains, and he will triumph over his enemy. Prostrating oneself in a dream also means repenting from sin, feeling regret, salvation, escaping from danger, or receiving pardon. Prostrating during a war in a dream means humiliation before one’s enemy, a fight, business losses, or it could mean standing helpless before closed doors. Prostrating oneself before God Almighty on top of a mountain in a dream means vanquishing a strong enemy, while prostrating on top of a hill means submission to a strong man. Prostration in a dream also means faith in God Almighty, joining the company of God’s messenger upon whom be peace, in paradise, longevity and improving one’s spiritual life. If one sees a piece of gold prostrating to a piece of silver in a dream, it means that a nobler person will submit to a lowly one. (Also see Prayers*)";
