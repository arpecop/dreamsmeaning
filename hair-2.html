var content = "In a dream, hair represents money and longevity. If a rich person ties a strand of hair to a bun of his own in a dream, it means increase of his wealth and growth of his business based on a business loan or a mortgage. If a poor person sees that in a dream, it means that he will borrow money to pay for his debts and still borrow more money to pay for his daily expenses. If one sees his straight hair frizzed or curled in a dream, it means that he will be honored, and if he sees his frizzed hair straight in a dream, it means that he will suffer from humiliation or lose his rank. If one with a straight and lanky hair sees it longer than usual in a dream, it means that money belonging to someone for whom he works will be distributed, wasted, or lost. If one’s hair is soft and lanky but still looks longer than usual in a dream, it means that his manager’s authority will expand, and his interests will diversify. If a strong man or a warrior sees himself having a bun of hair in a dream, it means protection and respect inspired by a strong personality. Otherwise, if he is rich in the dream, a bun here means more wealth, and if he is a poor, it represents his debts. If one’s hair looks curly in a dream, it means that power, honor and praises will be the lot of his superior. If a woman sees her hair straight in a dream, it denotes benefits and particularly if she uses a hair pieces or a wig as part of her makeup. Women receive benefits from braiding their hair in a dream and it means saving money or investing it. Otherwise, if a poor person, or a blind person braids his or her hair in a dream, then it means complications and difficulties, and particularly when they are accustomed to doing so. If a sick woman sees herself braiding her hair in a dream, it means that she will die from her illness. If one sees his hair long to the extent that he could braid it together with his beard in a dream, it means debts. Shaving one’s moustache, or under one’s armpit in a dream means paying one’s debts, dispelling distress, or following good hygienes. Braiding one’s hair in a dream also means mastering one’s craft. Shaving one’s head during the pilgrimage season in a dream means safety and protection. Shortening one’s hair, or removing unwanted hair during makeup in a dream means dispelling stress, or being coerced to pay one’s debts. If a thief or a fugitive sees himself grabbing to his own long and lanky horse like hair in a dream, it means that he will be captured. If one sees himself having hair like that of a hog in a dream, it connotes major calamities. If an unhappy person sees himself hairy in a dream, it means aggravation of his depression and unhappiness, while if a happy person sees himself hairy in a dream, it means increase of his happiness. The black hair of a woman in a dream represents her husband’s love for her. If a woman sees herself wearing a veil, or putting on a head piece in a dream, it means a journey that will take her husband away from her from sometime, or a journey from which he may never return. If she sees people looking at her hair in a dream, it means that she will suffer slander and defamation. If a man sees himself with horns formed from his own hair in a dream, it means might and adroitness. If one sees the hair in the back of his head disheveled or rumpled in a dream, it means that he will suffer humiliation. If he sees his hair on the right side of his head tousled in a dream, it means that he will molest male children from amonghis relatives. If he sees his hair on the left side of his head tousled, or disheveled in a dream, it means that he will molest female children from among his relatives. If one does not have relatives, it means that he will suffer harm from his evil actions. If one sees long hair under his armpit in a dream, it means he will attain his goal, or it could denote his generous character. If he sees it thick in a dream, it denotes his thirst for knowledge, search for a business, or profiting through patience and endurance. If one sees his hair infested with lice in a dream, it means that he has a large family. If one sees his hair longer or thicker, and if he wishes in the dream to have that in wakefulness, it means that he will attain his goals, pay his debts, or prosper. If the length or thickness of one’s hair is uncommon, and if one feels no offense to walk with it in the streets in his dream, it means debts, distress and inability to take care of one’s family. Long hair in a dream also means naughtiness and adversities. Thick and long hair in a dream also can be interpreted as having many children, or it could represent fear of wrongdoing, or thinking about an important person, or it could represent common daily concerns. Having less hair in a dream means diminishing difficulties. If one sees someone pulling out his hair in a dream, it means that he may have to face a financial disaster. If a woman sees a strand of her hair being cut in a dream, it means a fight between her and her husband, or it could mean that someone is encouraging her husband to seek another woman. If one sees himself grooming his hair with oily dressing in a dream, it means adorning oneself for the world. If the oil runs over one’s face in the dream, it means trouble. Discovering a bad odor emanating from one’s hair in the dream means hearing praises. Delousing one’s hair in a dream means discovering some of one’s own faults. If some lice fall during the combing of one’s hair in a dream, it means that he will spend a portion of his inheritance in charity, or that he will clean his act, or correct his attitude. If one sees his hair growing anew in a dream, it means that he may lose most of his wealth. If one sees hair growing on his face where hair does not usually grow in a dream, it means debts. If one sees hair growing in the palm of his hand in a dream, it means benefits from a business. A hairy chest, or hair growing over one’s tongue in a dream means wisdom, clarity, or diligence, except if it grows beyond control, then it becomes adversities, stress, sorrows, debts and so forth. If one sees the hair on his forearm scattering, or falling in a dream, it means that he may lose all his savings. Braiding the hair of one’s legs in a dream means earning money through improper methods, or engaging in something which contradicts the divine laws. Woman’s hair in a dream represents her protection, husband or family. Hair in a dream also denotes farming, money, a wife, a husband or marriage. If one’s hair looks ugly and smelly in a dream, it represents the living condition or the state of the husband and wife. Nicely combing one’s hair in a dream means loyalty and fulfilling a promise. As for a person who lacks loyalty, shaving his hair or cutting it short in a dream means squandering money, though in general shortening one’s hair means knowledge and guidance. Combing the hair of one’s wife in a dream means divorce. Good looking hair in a dream represents a person of good character. Hair in a dream also means feeling apprehensive about something. If one’s hair turns into an animal’s hair in a dream, it means toiling and difficulties. If a poor person sees that dream, it means that his basic needs will be adequately satisfied. The eyebrows, eyelashes, hairy arms, hairy legs and a hairy chest in a dream also represent man’s virility, beauty, protection, or lasting wealth. Hair in one’s ears in a dream means knowledge, or admonition. Seeing hair in one’s noses in a dream represents a beneficial thing one breezes, though it may involve some hidden trouble, or it could mean money. Hair covering woman’s body in a dream means remaining celibate and for a married woman it means taking care of her parents and children. A hairy child in a dream means longevity. If a beardless man sees himself hairy in a dream, it means that his wife will soon be pregnant. If one’s hair turns white in a dream, it means loss of money for a rich person, or paying the debts of a poor person. (See Black hair | Dye | Shaving | Strand of hair)HiI’ve been having this nightmare. Quite often lately and I thought, maybe there’s a reason for that. The dream:
 I’m at work, in the middle of the night. (I work at a center for disabled people – both in real life and in the dream.) Awful things happen, but the the thing that happens again and again is me, pulling an infinitely long hair out of my throat. I have dreamed this quite a few times lately now. 
My question is, is there any sylmbolic things about pulling hair out of your throat? 
My father told me he had this dream too when he was younger. 
I’m not a believer in any paranormal things or psychic powers og anything like that, so i don’t want to know what it means if you can only tell me what will soon happen in my life, cause i don’t believe that’s possible. There’s a lot of changes and things i have to choose between in my life at the moment, and that might just be the reason for my nightmares – thats what i thing. Anyway, Hope to get an answer. Thanks you!";
