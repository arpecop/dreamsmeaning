var content = "(Thief | Trifler | Womanizer | Year) In a dream, a wolf represents a fierce enemy, an unrelenting thief, or a liar. If one sees a wolf entering his house in a dream, it means that a thief will burglarize his house and that he will chase and capture him. If one sees himself raising a wolfs cub in a dream, it means that he will raise an abandoned child of a thief who upon growing up will bring that family much pain, suffering, divisiveness and loss of property. Seeing a wolf in a dream also could represent false allegations one may fabricate to assault an innocent person. If one sees a wolf turning into a steer in the dream, it means that a boy who is used to stealing will repent for his sin, turn to honesty, trustworthiness and grow to become a good and a generous person. Seeing a wolf in a dream also means receiving praises from one’s superior at work, or it could represent profits from one’s job. If a wolf chases someone in a dream, it means that the person will see happiness, or it could mean his martyrdom. A wolf in a dream also represents the days of the year, or it could mean the four seasons. If one turns into a gentle lamblike wolf in a dream, it means that he is a thief who will repent for his sin. If one turns into a wolf in a dream, it means that he will earn personal joy and happiness. Wolfs milk in a dream represents fear, stress, or forfeiture of a project. A wolf in a dream also represents a tyrant, a weak thief, or a liar. A clash with a wolf in a dream means a clash with a rival. If a wolf and a dog make a pact of friendship in a dream, it means that one will witness hypocrisy and deceit.";
