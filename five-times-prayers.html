var content = "(Communication | Communion | Invocations | Prayers | arb. Salat) To see oneself performing one’s obligatory prayers {arb. Fardh) in a dream means receiving a high ranking appointment, spiritual advancement, leadership, presiding over people, delivering a message, performing a duty, paying dues, turning over one’s trust or satisfying obligatory deeds and enjoying peace. If one sees himself in a dream performing one of the five obligatory prayers on time, having performed the proper ablution and correctly completed its obeisance of the proper standing, bowing and prostrating postures, standing with reverence and piety and facing the Ka’aba, it means that he will perform a religious duty or attend the annual pilgrimage in Mecca. It also means that he will extricate himself from an unjust deed he fell into and repent, or it could mean eschewing evil. Performing the divinely ordained prayers in dream also means loyalty to one’s promise, employment for a person who could not find a job, or reconcili- ation with a long forsaken friend or relative. If one leads the prayers in his dream, it means that he will guarantee something to someone, or it could means that he will borrow money for a term. If one prays behind an Imam in the dream, it means that he will become a burden to others. The midday prayers known in Arabic as Zuhur signify a manifestation, a proclamation or exposing what is hidden. Praying Zuhur in a dream means attaining one’s goal, satisfying every need, obtaining everything one has asked for from earthly gains in this world, or it could mean spiritual benefits in the hereafter and particularly if one sees himself completing his prayers in the dream. Completing one’s prayers means achieving one’s goal. If one is incarcerated because of a debt and sees himself completing his Zuhur prayers in a dream, it means that someone will pay his debt for him and gets him released from prison and he will then prosper. If one sees himself performing his Zuhur prayers in a clear day and feels happy about it in his dream, it means that he will engage in some work that will make him famous and that he will enjoy the fruits of his work as much as he did in that clear and beautiful day in his dream. If one performs his midday Zuhur prayers in a cloudy day in a dream, it means that his work will be distressful. As for the mid-afternoon prayers, known in Arabic as ‘Asr, performing it in a dream means taking a vow or making a promise. This prayer in a dream also represents one’s liability. If one sees himself performing the ‘Asr prayers in a dream, it means that what he is asking for will materialize, though after some hardships and adversities. If one does not complete his ‘Asr prayers in a dream, it means that what he is asking for may not take place. If one sees himself performing the sunset prayers, known in Arabic as Maghrib in a dream, it means that what he is seeking has reachd its term. If one completes his Maghrib prayers in the dream, it means that he will get what his heart desires. As for the night prayer, known in Arabic as ‘Isha. If one sees himself performing his Tsha prayers in a dream, it means that he will complete his work and get what he wants, or it could mean the end of his life, following which , one usu ally attends to his resting time, which is similar to death. If one sees himself performing the daybreak prayers before dawn in a dream, it means that the morning has come and it will be soon before he hears either good or bad news. On another level, if one sees himself praying the evening ‘Isha prayers in a dream, it means that he is committed to attend to his family’s needs as commanded by God Almighty, such as providing for their food, clothing, shelter and teachings. If one sees himself praying in the middle of the night (arb. Witter) in a dream, it means that he does attend to his family’s needs and perhaps they feel comfort in his presence. If one sees himself performing the dawn Fajr prayers in a dream, it means that he will start with the inevitable, such as working to provide for his family. If one sees himself performing the midday Zuhur prayers at the time of the mid-afternoon prayers in a dream, it means that he will repay his debts. If one’s midday Zuhur prayers or his mid-afternoon ‘Asr prayers are interrupted in the dream, it means that he will pay half of what he owes. If one sees himself performing the mid-afternoon prayers in a dream, it means that his job will shortly be completed and only little work is left for him to finish. Praying the sunset Maghrib prayers in a dream means finishing one’s duties and it is time for him to take a rest. The night ‘Isha prayers in a dream means veiling things or entering the privacy of one’s home. On a third level, the midday guhur prayers mean repentance, dismissal or abrogation of laws. The midday Zuhur prayers also could mean struggling against Satan and one’s enemies, which struggle takes place usually at the time of one’s midday nap. The mid-afternoon ‘Asr prayers in a dream also represents victory in one’s life, or it could mean guidance, blessings and observing God’s laws. The sunset Maghrib prayers in a dream means losing a parent, the passing away of one’s guardian, the death of a close friend or the impeachment of the person the dream indicate. Seeing oneself praying the night ‘Isha prayers in a dream means preparing for a journey, or it could mean marriage, moving from one place into another, or it could mean suffering from cataract, weakness of one’s vision, or it could denote the vastness of what is to come, for ‘Isha prayers are distant from the dawn Fajr prayers. Performing the dawn Fajr prayers in a dream indicates a vow one pledges. Praying the mid- afternoon ‘Asr prayers in a dream means attaining ease after suffering from hardships. Performing the sunset Maghrib prayers in a dream means having crossed something that will come back later, and performing the night ‘Isha prayers in a dream means deception and a tricks. If one sees himself performing the Friday congregational prayers in a dream, it means that he will attain what he is hoping for. If one sees himself praying inside a garden in a dream, it means that he is beseeching God Almighty for His forgiveness. If one sees himself praying in a farmland in a dream, it means repayment of his debts. If he prays inside a slaughter house in a dream, it means that he will commit the loathsome act of sodomy. If one sees himself praying seated without an excuse in a dream, it means that he will perform a deed which is not acceptable by his Lord. If he prays lying on his side in bed in a dream, it means that he will be bed stricken. If one performs his prayers in a mosque, then leaves it to attend to other duties in a dream, it means that whatever he attends to will be blessed, and he will profit from it. If one sees himself praying while riding in a dream, it means that he is struck with fear , or that he may face a fight. If one sees himself performing the obligatory (arb. Fardh) prayers shortened to two groupings of prostrations (arb. Rak’at) in a dream, it means travels. If one sees himself praying while eating honey in a dream, it means that he may engage in sexual intercourse with his wife during the fasting hours. If a woman sees herself performing the obligatory (arb. Fardh) prayers shortened to two grouping of prostrations in a dream, it means that she will have her monthly menstrual period on that day. If one discovers that he has missed the time of the prescribed prayer and could not find a place or time to perform it in his dream, it means that he will face difficulties finishing something or paying a debt or satisfy a worldly goal. If one intentionally neglects to do an obligatory prayer, or if he plans to do them later (arb. Qada’) in the dream, it means that he takes his religious commitment lightly and hopes to correct his attitude at a later time. Performing the Friday congregational prayers in a dream is a sign of happiness, joy, festivities, celebrations, the pilgrimage season, abstaining from borrowing money for one’s accessories or luxuries. Performing the festival prayers (arb. Eid) at the end of the month of Ramadan in a dream means paying one’s debts, recovering from an illness, dispelling difficulties and dissipating one’s worries. Performing the prayers ofthe festival of sacrifice (arb. Eid-ulAdha. See Immolation | Manumission) in a dream means controlling one’s business, respecting one’s promises or fulfilling one’s vows. Performing the mid-morning prayers (arb. Dhuha) in a dream means amnesty, innocence, making a true oath, happiness and being free from polytheism. If one performs the prayer of a sick person in a dream, it means lack of luck and doubt about one’s faith. Grouping two prayers at one time or shortening them in a dream, means travels or temptation. Performing one’s prayers directly on a filthy, wet and impure ground without a prayer mat means poverty, humiliation and needs. If one sees himself praying without properly covering his or her modesty as required in a dream, it means committing wrong while fasting or giving charity from unlawful earnings, following innovation, falling victim to passions or professing that one is right however he does his prayers. If one performs the prayers of fearing something in a dream, it means creating a business partnership, business activities or suffering the pangs of death. Talking during prayers in a dream means asking to get back a gift one has offered, or failure to focus one’s intention, or talking about one’s charities in public. In a dream, when performing one’s prayers, if one reads loud when he should read inwardly, or if he reads inwardly when he is supposed to invoke outwardly, and if he is called upon to judge between people, it means that his judgment will be wrong or that he may follow his own mind, or it could mean affectation, falsehood, hypocrisy, hiding the truth or unjustly confiscating someone’s money. If one changes the order of the ritual prayers in a dream, it means that he disobeys his parents or objects to someone he is supposed to hear and obey, or perhaps he will be afflicted with forgetfulness or staying-up sleepless nights, or it could mean that he lacks intelligence, or that he is unable to memorise or remember things. Performing the late night prayers, (arb. Tarawih) in a dream means toiling, exhaustion, repayment of one’s debts and receiving guidance. Performing a special prayer for rain {arb. Istisqa) in a dream denotes fears, languid, rising prices, dullness of the market, trouble, unhappi- ness, attachment and stagnation of the construction business. Performing the solar or the lunar eclipse prayers in a dream means striving to deliver comfort or to appease someone or perhaps it could denote repentance of a sinner, returning to the path of God Almighty, fearing the authorities, difficulties, or manifestation of major signs of the fast approaching Hour of Reckoning. Performing a special prayer of fear (arb. Khawf) in a dream represents unity, concord, common consent, peace and tranquility. Performingthe funeral prayers (arb. Janaza) in a dream means interceding on behalf of the deceased. If the deceased is unknown, then performing the funeral prayers means giving employment to a jobless person, profits from a partnership, or it could denote failure to adequately perform one’s regular obligatory prayers, or being forgetful or oft-distracted during prayers. If one sees himself leading the funeral prayers in a dream, and then after completing his prayers intercedes exaggeratedly with special invocations on behalf of the deceased in a dream, it means that he will be appointed by a ruler who is a hypocrite to manage a sector of his business. If one sees himself then invoking blessings upon the deceased in the dream, it means that God Almighty has forgiven him his sins. If one sees himself sitting in a gathering of people praying for dep arted souls in a dream, it means that he will pray in a funeral. Seeing oneself in a dream performing a funeral prayer, means that one will intercede on behalf of a sinner. If one sees himself performingthe Friday congregational prayers {arb. Jumu’a) in a dream, it means that relief is coming his way, or it could mean a reunion with a beloved, or satisfying a need one is asking for it to be fulfilled. If one sees himself praying the Friday prayers alone in the dream, it means that such help is exclusive to him. If one loses something and sees himself in a dream celebrating one of the two Islamic festivals, it means that he will find his lost object. If one sees himself performingthe festival prayers {arb. ‘Eid) of the end of the month of Ramadan in the dream, it means perosperity, and if it is the festival of sacrifice in the dream, it means repayment of his debts, dispelling stress, advancement in one’s life or job or release from prison. Performing either the solar or the lunar eclipse prayers {arb. Kusiif or Jthusiif) in a dream means that a calamity will befall the leaders of the country or its renowned people, or it could mean the death of a great person of knowledge, whereby everyone will attend his funeral. As for the special prayer for rain {arb. Istisqa), performing it in a dream may represent an accident, or it could mean political unrest.
