var content = "Dreaming of a college, denotes you are soon to advance to a position long sought after. Dreaming that you are back in college, foretells you will receive distinction through some well favored work. For the past month or so I have had a re-accuring dream of going back to to the same college I actually attended after high school in 1971. I am looking for classes&#x2F; buildings that were once familiar but are no longer. Other, younger students go by confidently as I try to find my way around. I wake up feeling unsettled, uncomfortable, distressed.. Last night, I dreamt I was taking my daughter to this college. In general, school&#x2F;classes are stressful for me demanding a focus and energy I rarely have now. . I would appreciate your input!";
