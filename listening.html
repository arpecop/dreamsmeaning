var content = "In a dream, listening to the Qur’an, or to the teachings of God’s Prophet, upon whom be peace, or to words of wisdom, or to an admonition, or a discourse of knowledge in a dream means receiving guidance, and it means turning repentantly to God Almighty. Otherwise, if one sees himself listening to backbiting, slandering, defamation, or eavesdropping in a dream, then it means that some harm will befall him. Listening to good advice and following its best guidance in a dream means receiving good news. Eavesdropping in a dream means that one intends to defame the other person. Listening, though pretending not to hear what is being said in a dream means that one makes it a habit to lie. The sound of a crowd in a dream means money beside other benefits. The bleating of sheep in a dream means distress and fear. The neighing of horses in a dream means might and honor. The barking of a dog in a dream means vein talk and meddling in people’s business. The sound of a lynx in a dream means pampering oneself, or wantonness. The cooing of pigeons in a dream means crying, sorrows or marriage. The chirp of swallows in a dream means beneficial words. The croaking of frogs in a dream means beatings. The sound of bells and the hissing of snakes in a dream means a fight, an argument, a warning, or a war. The braying of donkeys in a dream means cursing in the darkness. The braying of mules in a dream means vein talk, or indulging in suspicious acts. The mooing of a cow in a dream means temptation. The gurgling of camels in a dream means travels and difficulties. The roaring of a lion in a dream means threats. The yowling of a tomcat in a dream means uproar, backbiting, defamation and insinuation. The yapping of foxes in a dream means a warning to escape, or to move from one field into another. The howling of a wolf in a dream means a robbery. The squeak of a mouse in a dream means profits, reunion, love and peace. The crying of a female gazelle in a dream means longing for one’s homeland. The barking of a jackal in a dream means a mission of good intent, or a forthcoming evil. (Also see Eavesdropping | Sound of animals | Speaking)";
