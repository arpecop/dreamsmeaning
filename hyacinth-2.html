var content = "(Bulbs | Gem | Sapphire) These bulbous and bell-shaped flowers in a dream differ in meaning depending on their type, shape and fragrance. If one smells a hyacinth flower in a dream, it means relief from sorrow, end of adversities, good deeds, or making a true promise. If one sees a deceased person carrying such a flower, or offering him a hyacinth flower to smell in a dream, it means that the deceased person is dwelling in paradise. If an unwed person sees a hyacinth flower in his dream, it means that he will get married. If a married person sees a hyacinth flower in his dream, it means that he will beget a son, or he may acquire knowledge, or specialize in a scientific project that will add to his pride. Perhaps, a fragrant hyacinth in a dream could mean distur- bances, distress, or a sickness. It is said that any flower from the lily family may represent death when presented to a sick person in a dream. A healthy hyacinth plant in the ground means a beautiful son, or good words. A garland of hyacinth flowers in a dream means honor. A hyacinth flower salesman in a dream represents a worrisome person, for such flowers do not remain long in his possession. If any of the flowers of the lily family are cut, or made into a bouquet in the dream, then they mean sorrow, and if they are seen on their mother plant, they mean happiness, a husband or a son. If one sees a hyacinth flower being raised to the heavens in a dream, it means the death of a gnostic or that of a renowned scholar. A hyacinth in a dream also represents a son when standing erect in the fields, and it represents a woman when gathered as a bouquet of flowers, while it means a calamity if seen cut and placed inside a flower pot, a vase , or in an inappropriate place. A hyacinth flower in a dream also represents a beautiful woman or blessings, its fragrance represents one’s love for his wife, and its tenderness represents one’s concern and support for his family. Seeing branches of hyacinth spread inside a house in a dream means lauding or commending someone. If one is offered a hyacinth flower but find that it carries no fragrance in the dream, it means an adversity. If one throws a hyacinth flower to another person in a dream, it means that the receiver will experience sorrow at his hand and that their friendship will be hampered. If one sees another person sitting inside a mosque and surrounded with hyacinth in a dream, it means that the other person is backbiting him though what he is saying is not true.
