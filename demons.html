var content = "I had a dream that I was driving a motor boat along the coast of one of several islands with 2 people. I looked behind us and there were 2 or 3 big eyed demons with sharp teeth in the water. They look like they were pushing waves at us cuz every time I felt a wave and looked back they were there sitting on top of a wave, but they stayed the same distance behind us. The 2 people in the boat with me disappeared and one of the demons was on my back. I was too scared to look back anymore so I kept driving the boat while looking forward and the demon on my back hand its hands on my shoulders and I could feel it’s teeth on my lower back. Then I woke up. I went back to sleep and I had a dream that I was lying on my bed and a red demon with black horns was doing the same thing. He had his hands on my shoulders and I could feel his teeth on my back. I lie on my stomach when I sleep and I guess that’s why I was lying that way in my dream.In my dream I turn into a demon and my best friend turns into an angel. We fight in side an  old abandoned cathedral. I throw him throw the ceiling and then I wake up. Please some tell me what it means. I’ve had the same exact dream for 3 days.hellow i dreamed  just today i was praying together of 3 old lady but the the other old lady ask for help but the moment i try to touch her the devil or demons or skull cover with golden fire  it’s  looking at eye to eye and when i  wake up my both hands is hot.Why????";
