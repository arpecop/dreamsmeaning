var content = "(Inner and outer struggle) Joining the warriors in the battlefield in a dream means that one is a true worshiper who attends to his regular prayers and pays his charities and due alms. If one sees the people charging toward the battle- field, it means that they will receive an endowment of divine forgiveness, victory, might and unity between the believers. To die as a martyr on God’s path in a dream means joy, happiness and prosperity. Joining a jihad battle in the sea in a dream means poverty, failure and walking toward destruction. Winning a sea battle in Jihad against a tyrant in a dream means restoring one’s religious commitment, and it could represent a protective jealousy for one’s wife, or winning a struggle in favor of one’s parents. Victory in the battlefield during Jihad means profits in one’s business. Returning from a holy war against an oppressor in a dream means that one may lose his religious commitment or disobey his parents, which is a major sin in Islam. (Also see Inner struggle)";
