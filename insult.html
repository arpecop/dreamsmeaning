var content = "(Abuse | Cursing | Swearing | Vilify) Insulting someone in a dream could represent the dignity of the one impugning upon the other person, and the unworthiness of the person who is insulted. There is an exception to that interpretation when the person insulting the other in the dream has suspicious motives, and the one who is abused in the dream is supposed to command respect. It is also said that the one who is insulted or abused in the dream may owe something to his assailant and must repay him. If the one insulting is of a higher social rank, then the victim in the dream is better than his attacker. However, in general, an abused person in the dream is ultimately the victorious one in wakefulness. (Also see Insulting)";
