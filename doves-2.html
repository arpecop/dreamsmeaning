var content = "Dreaming of doves mating and building their nests, represents peacefulness of the world and joyous homes where children render obedience, and mercy is extended to all. In the dream to hear the lonely, mournful voice of a dove, portends sorrow and disappointment through the death of one to whom you looked for aid. Often it portends the death of a father. To see a dead dove in the dream, is ominous of a separation of husband and wife, either through death or infidelity. To see white doves, denotes bountiful harvests and the utmost confidence in the loyalty of friends. Dreaming of seeing a flock of white doves, denotes peaceful, innocent pleasures, and fortunate developments in the future. If one brings you a letter, tidings of a pleasant nature from absent friends is intimated, also a lovers’ reconciliation is denoted. If the dove seems exhausted, a note of sadness will pervade the reconciliation, or a sad touch may be given the pleasant tidings by mention of an invalid friend | if of business, a slight drop may follow. If the letter bears the message that you are doomed, it foretells that a desperate illness, either your own or of a relative, may cause you financial misfortune. ";
