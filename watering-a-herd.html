var content = "Watering a herd in a dream means profits from travels.I had a dream that me my girlfriend and a friend was driving on the freeway. I to ell them I see a tornado a head. We see a plane trying to get a way. We seen the left wing snap. I told my friend to turn around. Then we got sucked into the tornado. The tornado was made out of water. I ended up out of the car holding on to the roof with everything I had. Everything slowed down like time stood still. I was panicking and I was scared for our lives I preyed to god. Crazy thing is I could feel everything. My fingers slip off the roof in don’t know if I died but when I woke up it was two figures spiritual like in front of me. What does this mean?";
