var content = "(Pawn | Deposit) If one sees himself as a hostage in a dream, it means that he has earned himself an accumulation of sins that made him a pawn for repayment of his debts. If one sees himself holding someone as a guarantee for a promise, or keeping him as a pawn until his demands are met in a dream, it means that he is veering toward injustice. A hostage in a dream also represents mistakes, errors, exposing people’s private life, divulging people’s secrets, slander, or a debt that keeps the person subject to constant harassment. Being a hostage in a dream also means adversities, trials, or falling in love with someone, whereby, one’s heart becomes a hostage of his beloved. (Also see Enemy | Enmity)";
