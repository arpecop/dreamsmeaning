var content = "In adream, shooting arrows is interpreted like shelling someone or a place. Otherwise, they means backbiting people or slandering them. Shooting arrows in a dream also could mean taking medicine, or giving an injection to a patient. If the arrows do not have arrowheads in the dream, then they mean disappointment. If one shoots arrows and finds himself also at the receiving end in a dream, it means that he will attain his goal of meeting his Lord. However, if he remains in this world, it means that he will rise in station and receive honor. If one sees two rows of people shooting arrows at each other in his dream, it means that the successful ones would be right and the losers would be at fault. Shooting arrows at people in a dream then means backbiting people, slandering them, or it could mean vain talking. If one constantly fails his aim in his dream, it means that he has an evil speaking tongue. Hitting one’s target in a dream means attaining one’s goals, or speaking the truth regarding someone he knows. Wearing a white garment and standing on top of a mountain and shooting arrows toward the East and the West in a dream means attaining a vast control over people and lands, if one qualifies. One’s arrows in a dream also represent his message or writings. (Also see Arrows | Hunting | Shelling)";
