var content = "A mold maker in a dream represents a gnostic, or a genius who teaches each and everyone of his students what they particularly need. Since molds are containers, then he represents a man of knowledge who understands and protects people’s secrets. A mold maker practicing his trade, buying and selling what he casts in a dream represents someone who is well acquainted with his profession, and who knows how to promote his services. A molder in a dream is also interpreted as a person who encourages people to travel even as far as China to acquire knowledge. (Also see Mold)";
