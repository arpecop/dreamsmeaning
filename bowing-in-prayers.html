var content = "(arb. Rukii’) Seeing oneself bowing to God Almighty in prayers in a dream means submission to His will, abstaining from arrogance and establishing God’s rules in one’s life. Bowing in prayers also means fulfilling one’s aspirations in this world and quickly triumphing over one’s enemy. If one sees himself standing in prayers, but remains standing without bowing until the prescribed time elapses in a dream, it means that he does not pay his due alms. Bowing in prayers in a dream also means a job for someone who needs it most. Bowing in a dream also means longevity. If a woman sees herself bo wing before God Almighty in prayers in a dream, it means repentance and exalting her name by protecting her chastity. (Also see Prayers)";
