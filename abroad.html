The dream tells you that there are changes in your life, that have to be done, without changing the environment you are at the moment. However, this means that there are some things in your life that has to become opposite then they are now. You might need to change your job, go for a hollidays, broke up or get divorced to someone. This is a sign of you growing as a person spiritualy. The dream can also represent something you are going to run away from.";
