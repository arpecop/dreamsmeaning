var content = "(Hymn | Remembrance of God | Songs of God’s love | Supplications) If one sees himself in a dream participating in a circle of people remembering God Al- mighty, or calling upon His most beautiful name, or invoking His divine attributes, or reading the Qur’an, or reciting devotional songs, it means that such location will be built as a holy place to celebrate God’s praises. The goodness of that place depends on the quality of reading, or the degree of devotion seen in the dream. When it is an ascetic song in the dream, it means that one’s deputyship is established correctly, but if one sees himself singing a sensual love song, then it means temptations. If one sees himself repeatedly calling God’s name in a dream, it means that he will win victory over his enemy. Calling people to God and reminding them of His attributes in a dream represents the work of a preacher who admonishes people, helps them to the shore of safety, and distances them from their sins and their consequences. If a merchant sees himself callingupon God’s beautiful names in a dream, it means that his business will be saved from bankruptcy. If a disbeliever, a profane or a secular person sees himself in a state of remembering God Almighty and calling upon His most holy attributes in a dream, it means that he may fall sick, or face great adversities, while in his heart, he will remain pleading with God Almighty for mercy and relief, though he may remain silent in public regarding his inner faith, and in fear of being ridiculed by his own circles. If during his dream one speaks words of truth and wisdom, it means that he will recover from his adversity and be cured from his illness. Furthermore, he will move into a more comfortable life and begin a life of sharing and doing good deeds in this world, or he may receive guidance and light, and faith will permeate his heart. If one says his prayers with a twang in a dream, it means that he will linger in difficulties, and that people will mock him too. (Also see Supplications)";
