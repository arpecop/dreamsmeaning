var content = "(Armor | Kingdom | Money | Peace | Shield) In a dream, a coat of mail represents protection from one’s enemy. If one sees himself making a coat of mail in a dream, it means that he will build a castle. To see oneself wearing one means becoming a leader. If a merchant sees himself wearing a coat of mail in a dream, it means that his business keeps growing, being completely sheltered and protected from losses. If the coat of mail is understood to mean a friend in the dream, then it will represent a gracious friend and a good helper when one needs him. A coat of mail also represents one’s son who is strong and capable, who suffices himself and helps his father. Wearing a coat of mail in a dream is a blessing and a favor one receives from a third party who will support him and defend him under all circumstances. Wearing one in a dream means protection for one’s wife, properties and interests. If a woman sees herself wearing a coat of mail in a dream, it means a husband and protection. It also could mean a supporting brother, a compassionate son, money, clothing or strong supporters. Wearing a suit of mail in a dream also means having a strong son, or it could mean travels.";
