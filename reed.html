var content = "(Cane) A reed in a dream represents the worst of people, or it could connote engaging in a despicable and a loathsome conversation. Leaning on a stick of reed in a dream represents the short span of life which remains for such a person, and it could mean that he will become poor before he dies. Reed in a dream also represents a frugal person who has loyalty to nothing, and who has no respect for the common norms or ideals. If one sees strips of reed turn into strips of silver or gold in a dream, then they denote good and valued deeds. Reeds in a dream also signify prosperity and wealth which is made from lawful earnings, a pure and a chaste wife, or good children. However, reeds in a dream also represent hypocrites, and if one hears their sound in his dream, it means an argument, or a fight. (Also see Caning | Sugar cane)";
