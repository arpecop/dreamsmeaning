var content = "In a dream, a well inside one’s house means prosperity, riches, a wife, business, a teacher, poverty, deception, fulfillment of one’s needs, travels, goals, stinginess, generosity, or it could mean a servant. The structural condition of each well in a dream has its own interpretation. A well in a dream also represent a woman who has a loud laughter, or it could represent a pleasant and an in- spiring woman. If a woman sees a well in a dream, it means meeting a man of good character. If one sees himself looking into a well in a dream, it means that he is thinking about a particular woman for marriage. A well in a dream is also interpreted to represent knowledge, marriage, a big man, prison, ties, or deception. If one digs a well and finds water in it in his dream, it means that he will marry a wealthy woman whom he will deceive. If the water gushes forth, rises and runs outside of an old well in the dream, it represents crying and grief in that place. Digging a well and finding water to channel for one’s garden in a dream means taking an herbal remedy to cure one’s impotence, or to save his marriage. Falling into a well of muddy waters in a dream means that one may become subject to the tyranny of an unjust ruler. If the water he falls into is clear in the dream, it means that he will willingly work to serve a righteous man and for a nominal wage. Falling into a well in a dream also means demotion, or it could mean travels. Sitting at the edge of a well in a dream means dealing with a deceiving person. A collapsed well in a dream represents a dying woman. Reaching a well which is dug for the general public to draw from its water means getting relief after suffering from difficulties. Finding a well adjacent to a barmaid in a dream means finding a spiritual teacher, or joining a fellowship and a school for the seekers. If one sees the well of Zamzam quenching the thirst of people in a particular neighborhood other than Mecca in a dream, it means that a gnostic will come to that town, and whose knowledge and wisdom will greatly benefit its people. It also may denote the bounty and blessings which are imparted to that town, or it could denote the victory of its people over their real enemy. Drinking from such a well in a dream means fulfillment of one’s intentions and satisfaction of his needs. In a dream, a well also means a prison or depression. If one is in such a state, it means that his adversities will dissipate, and that he will reestablish himself in the circles of people in authority. If the person in the dream is a seer who predicts events, then he may be involved in the circles of governors, particularly to interpret their dreams. It is possible that he also might receive emissaries of notable people who will bring him what pleases him. It also could mean a fight in one’s family involving jealousy, envy, betrayal, though at the end one will triumph over them. Falling into a well in a dream also means being indicted in an alleged crime from which one is clearly innocent. A well in a dream is also interpreted as levying taxes, or it could mean circumcision. Digging a well in a dream also represents a crafty and an artful deceiver.";
