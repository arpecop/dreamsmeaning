var content = "When you dream of seeing an airplane it means that you will deal with the difficulties and will get to higher level of consciousness which will lead you to satisfaction. You might start seeing things different with more intelligence and patience. If you see transfer planes, it means that you will move forward leaving your old life behind and finally getting the new one, the one you deserved. There will be many challenges you will have, but do not worry as you will cope with them perfectly. If you see that you are in the plane and it crashes, it represents your great expectations you expose to yourself, so do not try to achieve something you will not be able to. However, if you start believing yourself more and if you will become more confident person, anything is available to achieve. When you start believe in yourself, it will be hard to believe how everything will get the way you always wanted to be. If you see the airplane being hijacked, it means that you are confused and nervous of something that happened before.";
