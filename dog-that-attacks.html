var content = "If a dog is seen attacking and biting a person it means that the harm caused by his enemy ill not be confined to unpleasant words only but bodily harm as well.Dreamed a dog bit me on my right hand.  Someone warned me that there were several dogs  to be watch for while walking in route to a destination.  Only ONE of the dogs barked and then attacked me biting my right hand.  I tried to protect myself with a long board but the dog was not afraid and was able to bite me because the board was too long to effectively protect myself. The bite was not painful.  However, later in the same dream, I showed the bite to someone and the bite was an open gash (no pain or bleeding).  In the dream I remembered looking for a shorter weapon to protect myself because I had to go back past the dog on my way back.I dream that a dog owned by my family attacked me. The dog was big, black and extremely vicious but it only wanted to attack me and no one else in the family. the dog seem intelligent and can speak in the dream. The dog asked me what is a dog to me, it was already glaring at me because I didn’t want to upset it anymore I answered “a dog is a man’s best friend” the dog looked at me and replied “a man’s best friend?” and bit a hold in the middle finger of my right hand. My brother tried to restrain the dog but the dog wanted to viciously attack further. it got loose from my brother because he was not strong enough to restrain him, I ran and lock the front door and the dog ran to the back of the house, I manage to get to the door and lock it just before the dog got there. there was a small opening between the door so the dog tried to force itself through but couldn’t. one of its leg was already through the opening so I grab a torch that was sitting nearby and burned its leg at this time it woke out of the dream.I forgot to mention the bite did not hurt neither did it bleed.i dreamt that a dog attacked me and i shoved by wrist into its mouth to choke it following which i now gave it heavy punches in the neck &#x2F; throat region. what could this dream mean";
