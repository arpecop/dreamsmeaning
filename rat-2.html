var content = "A rat in one’s house in a dream means that he will emigrate from one land to another. If the person seeing the dream owns a house, it means that he will sell it. Rats in one’s house in a dream also represent thieves one must guard his house against, or that he must guard himself against the betrayal of a close acquaintance. Eating a rat in a dream means backbiting others, or earning unlawful money. In general, rats in a dream represent insolence, causing damage, fornication, adverse marital conditions, or problems in the upbringing of one’s children. Catching a rat in a dream means suffering from humiliation and despise.I dreamed of 2 white rats and about 3 pink babies (pinky) I started to play with them 1 grabbed my hand to bite but I didn’t pull back I just started to rub its head and it let me go and then got very affectionate. What is the meaning of that";
