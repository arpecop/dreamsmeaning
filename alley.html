var content = "When you dream of seeing an alley it represents your restricted choices. Maybe there are some things in your domestic surroundings which you do not know how to sort it out. When you dream of walking down the alley it symbolizes the danger you might be in. What you should do is to be more cautious and careful. This also could be a sign of someone talking behind your back, so be aware of that, as the image of yours could be understood in a negative way. This dream also tells you that mentally you might get tired and exhausted. Ty to look for support from people who genuinely loves you and cares about you.";
