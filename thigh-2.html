var content = "(Limb) One’s thighs in a dream represent his family or clan. Anything that affects them in the dream will manifest in his family or clan. If one sees his thighs missing something in a dream, it means that he is a foreigner, or that he does not know his lineage or ancestry. Experiencing pain in one’s thigh in a dream means doing harm to one’s own family or clan. If one sees that a piece of skin is crafted to his thigh in a dream, it means that someone will attribute a son to him, and it will turn to be a false allegation. Thighs in a dream also represent the pillars of one’s house, the head of a household, one’s wife, one’s husband, son, master, earnings, business, vehicle, or wealth. One’s thighs in their beautiful condition in a dream also represent the correctness of one’s prayers, or they may represent his garment, tools, or chair. Imputation of one’s thigh in a dream means taking a long journey and dying in a foreign country. (Also see Body 1 | Foot | Leg)";
