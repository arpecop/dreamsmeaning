var content = "(Scale) A balance and a scale in a dream have similar interpretations. Both represent faith, justice and righteousness in words and actions. In a dream, a balance also may represent a wife, or it could mean payment of one’s debts. A steelyard in a dream represents an architect or a builder. A miller’s scale in a dream represents a man who considers himself worthy of respect, while his actions, earnings and moves are contemptible. A precision scale in a dream represents a warning against heedlessness and concern for proper accounting for one’s actions. The justice scale represents a judge. If it stands balanced in one’s dream, then it means that the judge of that locality is a just and a learned person. In a dream, the scales of a balance represents the judge’s ears. The money put on a scale for measuring represents the lawsuits, and the weights represent the judgment. If one sees himself standing before God Almighty on Judgment Day and if his good deeds weigh heavier than his sins in the dream, it means that he will reckon himself, reflect about his bad actions and correct the course of his life. Consequently, his reward in the hereafter will be greater. Seeing the Balance of the Day of Judgement in a dream means vulnerability of people’s secrets, exposing one’s actions in public, recognition of the ultimate truth, joy, happiness, victory and justice. If one’s deeds are praiseworthy, then he will be a winner. If one’s deeds are blameworthy, then he will be a loser. In general, a balance in a dream represents a guide, an example to follow, a scholar one seeks to learn at his hand, a ruler, a criterion and the Qur’an. It also may represent one’s tongue and correctness, truthfulness, lies, incredulity or trustworthiness. (Also see Measure 2 | Measurer | Scale)";
