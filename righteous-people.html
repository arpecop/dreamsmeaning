var content = "(Companions of God’s Prophet, upon whom be peace | Follow- ers | Successors) Seeing God’s blessed people and His righteous ones, or any of the early companions of God’s Messenger (uwbp), whether such a companion is known or not in a dream represents blessings in one’s life and denotes one’s correct following of their example, and their advice or comments in one’s dream must be heeded. To see oneself as one of such true ones, or to enter their circles in a dream means that one is following their example and enjoying or suffering similar trials to theirs, then he will triumph over his enemies. To see one of the companions living in a city in a dream also represents the joy, happiness, prosperity, and justice the inhabitants of such a city enjoy under the leadership of a righteous governor. (Also see Companions of the Prophet | Scholars | Serving | Shepherd)";
