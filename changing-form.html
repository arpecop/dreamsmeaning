var content = "(See Transformation)Been having a dream my love is swept up in a cult and dies…but they say ‘reborn’ I am unsettled because I was ultra dreaming…meaning I had the opportunity to make the decision to sleep or stay awake. To choose my dreams not in content but in the manner of desiring to dream. It rocks me to this day. I am….shuddered…by the contents. I am not sure why. Had other terrible dreams, and they leave me. This one has taken hold. Is it my own will that it persists? I am exploring that now. Is it an embellished view of what I fear? as well, considering it now. But wanted more information. I am rocked. And fearful. I do not understand. Neither where it came from, or what it symbolizes for me. Not even content…it was devoid of content important to me. I am trying to find other ways to learn how to interpret this dream. I am not a dreamer, nor a great adept of anything. Just a dreamer exploring a dream world. I have gotten to the point of registering when I dream and when I wake. To feel the buzz of electricity on my body, and lucid, complacent muscles relenting to my sleep. Once in awhile I can re harness that and pull up the ability to know when I am about to sleep, and the feeling between dreams. I like this spot. But not where its leading…instead of awesome dreams of desire or exploration its been like..an alter universe. Like “this is where you could have lived” and its scary. I don’t like being scared of my dreams. Please any insight would be great.";
