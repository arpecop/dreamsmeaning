var content = "Seeing loose silk in a dream means being enamored, or falling in love. If a person in authority wears silk in a dream, it represents his arrogance. Wearing yellow or red silk in a dream means a sickness. If a warrior wears one of these two colors in his dream, it means that he will be decorated for his chivalry. If a man of knowledge is adorned with silk in a dream, it means that he is desirous of worldly status, or that he will lead people astray through innovation. As for the rest of people, wearing silken garments in a dream means that one’s deeds are worthy of paradise, though such a person may attain leading ranks and success in the world as well. Wearing a silken garment in a dream also means marriage to a woman from a noble lineage. Wearing a silken shawl without patterns in a dream is better than a cotton or a woolen shawl and particularly a patterned one. (Also see Silk merchant)";
