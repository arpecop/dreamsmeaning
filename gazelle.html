var content = "(Antelope | Deer | Woman) In a dream, a female gazelle represents a beautiful woman. Capturing a female gazelle in adream means taking advantage of a woman, or it could mean marriage. Throwing a stone at a gazelle in a dream means raping a woman, or committing a sin, or divorcing one’s wife or being violent with her. Hunting a gazelle in a dream means profits. Shooting a gazelle with arrows in a dream means slandering a woman. Slaughtering a gazelle in a dream means deflowering a female servant. If one sees himself turned into a deer in a dream, it means that he lives solely to satisfy his pleasures, lust and sensual desires in this world. If one receives the gift of a gazelle in a dream, it means that he will receive an inheritance and become wealthy. A gazelle in a dream also represents a child. If a gazelle enters someone’s house in a dream, it means that he will marry off his son. If a gazelle jumps at someone in his dream, it means that his wife will rebel against him. Running to catch a gazelle in a dream means gaining strength. Owning a gazelle in a dream also means earning lawful money or a marriage to a noble woman. If one kills a gazelle in a dream or if a gazelle dies in his arm in a dream, it means distress, sorrow and difficulties. (Also see Deer)";
