var content = "(Hog-like wolf) A hyena in a dream represents a fierce, an unjust and a perfidious enemy whose actions stem from the directives of an evil and an ugly old witch. If one sees himself eating the meat of a hyena in a dream, it means that he is bewitched and does not know it, though subconsciously, he will desire and seek to be free from such an evil spell. Riding a hyena in a dream means marriage. A lame hyena in a dream represents a witch, or the wife of an unknown person, a jobless person, a loafer, or a cheater. Riding a hyena in a dream also means gaining authority. A hyena in a dream also may denote exposing one’s secrets, interfering in people’s business, effeminacy, a her- maphroditic person, a wretched wife, or an ugly, treacherous and a disloyal woman. Thus, when interpreted to means a woman, it means that one may marry such a woman. Shooting a hyena with an arrow in a dream means corresponding with such a woman. Throwing a stone or a walnut at a hyena in a dream means slandering a woman. Hitting a hyena with a sword in a dream means lashing at such a woman with bad words. Drinking hyena’s milk in a dream means suffering losses at the hand of such a woman through betrayal. Stabbing a hyena in a dream means doing business with such a woman, or managing her business, or getting married to someone in her family. Getting hold of the skin, bones, or hair of a hyena in a dream means taking advantage of such a woman and using her for her money. If it is a male hyena in the dream, then it represents a criminal and a despised person.";
