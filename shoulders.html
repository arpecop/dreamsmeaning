var content = "(Friend | Responsibility | Support) Riding over the shoulders of one’s enemy in a dream means committing a wrongdoing or a shameful act against someone. If there is no enmity between the two, and if one sees himself riding over the shoulders of his friend in a dream, it means that he will earn something from him. Carrying someone over one’s shoulders in a dream means being indebted to him. Carrying a hypocrite over one’s shoulders in a dream could mean that one may work at a lumberyard, or deliver wood for living. One’s shoulders in a dream also represent his parents, brothers, partners, one’s station, or beauty. Anything that affects them in a dream will show in any of the above. Shoulders in a dream also represent one’s partner, his employee, assistant, or a close friend. As for a prisoner, having large shoulders in a dream means serving a long term imprisonment. Aching shoulders in a dream may represent the sickness of one’s brothers. Shoulders in a dream also represent one’s child, or the weight and amount of responsibilities one can assume. (Also see Body’ | Ride)";
