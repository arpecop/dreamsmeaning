var content = "(Abraham | Ismail | Immolation | Liberation) Manumission of a slave in a dream represents a ritual sacrifice, or the offering of an animal during the Feats of Immolation, on the 10th day of the Arabic month of Zul- Hijjah, and following the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. If one gives permission to his wife to leave him in a dream, it means that they will be divorced. If a bondman sees himself liberated in a dream, it means that he or his master may die shortly. If a bondman dies in a dream, it means that he will be liberated. Manumission means departure from bondage. If a sick person sees himself liberated from bondage in a dream, it means his death. If he is a sinner, it means that he will repent for his sin. If he is an atheist, it means that he will become a believer and God Almighty will forbid his flesh to hell-fire. If a free man sees himself liberated from slavery in a dream, it means that he will repay his debts, or repent for his sins. (Also see Feast of Immolation | Slave)";
