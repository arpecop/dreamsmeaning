var content = "Dreaming that you are abandoned, denotes that you will have difficulty in framing your plans for future success. To abandon others, you will see unhappy conditions piled thick around you, leaving little hope of surmounting them. If it is your house that you abandon, you will soon come to grief in experimenting with fortune. If you abandon your sweetheart, you will fail to recover lost valuables, and friends will turn aside from your favors. If you abandon a mistress, you will unexpectedly come into a goodly inheritance. If it is religion you abandon, you will come to grief by your attacks on prominent people. To abandon children, denotes that you will lose your fortune by lack of calmness and judgment. To abandon your business, indicates distressing circumstances in which there will be quarrels and suspicion. (This dream may have a literal fulfilment if it is impressed on your waking mind, whether you abandon a person, or that person abandons you, or, as indicated, it denotes other worries.) To see yourself or friend abandon a ship, suggests your possible entanglement in some business failure, but if you escape to shore your interests will remain secure. ";
