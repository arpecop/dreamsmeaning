var content = "(Bucket | Grammar teacher | Language teacher) In a dream, a teacher represents a strong person who does people favors and particularly those who learn at his hand unless if he takes monetary compensation for his work in the dream. An elementary school teacher in a dream represents a commander, a judge, a scholar, or a trainer. A grammar teacher and a language teacher in a dream represents honor, dignity, exalted rank, helping others, having impor- tant connections with people in authority, scholars, or he could represent understanding, clarity of speech, easy life, profits, marriage, children, or parents. A teacher in a dream also represents a bird hunter who presides over the affairs of ignorant people. (Also see Educator | Engraver | Grammarian | Language | Writer)";
