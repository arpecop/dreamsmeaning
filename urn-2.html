var content = "(Cistern | Container | Storing | Waterskin) In a dream, each type of urn is interpreted differently. A large urn represents a prostitute. In a dream, a cistern or any large conical jar made of porous clay and used in storing water represents a caretaker, a custodian or a curator, the head of the household, his safe, or his shop. If the urn is seen inside a house in a dream, it represents a rich woman who is always in grief. If it is connected to a water wheel in the dream, it represents a rich man who carries heavy responsibilities and who spends his money on God’s path. A waterskin in a dream represents a chaste woman. Drinking from a waterskin in a dream means receiving money or benefits from such a woman. If one sees himself drawing water from a storage tank then pouring it into an urn in the dream, it means that he will take advantage of such a woman. A wine pitcher in a dream means discovering a treasure. If one sees an urn containing vinegar in a dream, it represents a pious and a God-fearing person. If it stores butter or ghee for cooking in the dream, it represents a rich man who hides his wealth. If it stores pickles in the dream, it denotes a sick person. If an urn falls from one’s hands and breaks in the dream, it means a divorce. (Also see Pitcher)";
