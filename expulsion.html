var content = "(Banishment | Chasing away | Dismissal | Driving away | Eviction | Exile | Expel) Expulsion in a dream means imprisonment. It also means es- tablishing the superiority of the one who gives the order and the proof of the subject’s guilt. If one is exiled from his homeland in a dream, it means that he may enter a jail. If one is expelled from paradise in a dream, it means that he may experience poverty. If one evicts a man of knowledge or screams at him, or bewilders him in a dream, it means that he will face an extraordinary misfortune and confront a threatening and a cruel enemy. If a religious and a pious looking person is evicted or driven away from a place in a dream, it means that he is failing to fulfill his religious vow, or it could mean that he is avoiding to remain in the company of true pious people, ascetics, people of knowledge and noble ones. Expulsion in a dream also could denote misbehavior or ill conduct on the part of the evictor.";
