var content = "(The prophet Jacob, upon whom be peace.) Seeing God’s prophet Jacob (uwbp) in a dream means strength, living in God’s blessings and having many children. Some of the children will cause their father grief, though his distress will later dissipate. Seeing God’s prophet Jacob (uwbp) in a dream also means dispersal of one’s family that will be followed by a joyful reunion. Seeing God’s prophet Jacob (uwbp) in a dream also means earning God’s nearness through devotion, prayers, charity and good deeds. It also could mean temporary loss of one’s sight, finding a missing child, or suffering a trial because of one’s attachment to his blood ties, though God willing, the results will be positive. Seeing him in a dream also means a calamity, or loss of family and wealth. The person in the dream also will be endowed with great patience and will come out of it victorious. If a sick person sees him (uwbp) in his dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. If he has a prayer or a need, they will be fulfilled. If one sees himself wearing Jacob’s robe in a dream, it means that he will be afflicted with calamities, distress, separation from his family and beloveds, or it could mean an illness. At the end , his sufferings will vanish to be replaced with happiness. Seeing God’s prophet Jacob (uwbp) in a dream also means business, travels, rising prices, stashing merchandise then revealing it. If a woman sees Jacob’s wife in a dream, it means that she will be stripped of her wealth and become subject of defamation, though again, the conclusion of her case will turn positive. It also could mean the imprisonment of one of her children. If a sick person sees her in a dream, it means that he will recover by God’s mercy and grace, since her name was ‘Rahma’ (Mercy). (Also see Joseph, upon whom be peace.)";
