var content = "(Blow | Criticize | Smack) To lightly slap someone in a dream means to reprimand him, or to oblige him to recognize a favor, boasting about one’s generosity, or constantly reminding the other person of some shabby assistance. If one playfully slaps someone lightly on his cheek in a dream, it also means that the latter owes him something or a favor and the opposite is interpreted accordingly. Slapping someone’s face with anger in a dream means that the victim will triumph over the assailant. To slap someone in a dream also means recognition of his seniority or superiority. Threatening someone in a dream also maybe a recognition of his superiority. (Also see Digging up the past | Slapping | Threat)";
