var content = "(Books | Credentials | Letter | Newspaper | Records | Revelations | Scrolls | Studies) Papers in a dream represent witnesses, guidance, spiritual leaders, knowledge, warnings, or glad tidings. Holding papers in a dream means glad tidings and celebration. If a woman hands someone a piece of paper in a dream, then one may expect good news to arrive from one moment to another. If the woman who hands him the paper covers herself with a veil in the dream, it means that he should be careful. Carrying a folded piece of paper in a dream means that one may have an accident that could be the cause of his death. If one sees himself carrying a paper in his left hand in a dream, it means that he regrets something he did. Writing a paper with the left hand in a dream means writing poem, or committing abominable actions, or that one will beget a son from adultery. If a God fearing person sees himself looking at a paper written in a language he cannot decipher in a dream, it means that he will face humiliation or suffer from distress. If one is offered a wrapping paper and he finds a newborn baby wrapped inside it in a dream, it means that he will hire a servant with some strings attached to his employment. If one is given a newspaper, or a document but does not care to read it in his dream, it means that he may receive an inheritance. If one reads the title page of a newspaper in a dream, it also means that he may receive an inheritance. If he quickly browses through it in his dream, then it means debts. To see one’s records of the Day of Judgment open before his own eyes in a dream, it denotes his faith, certitude, lack of doubt and true belief in what God’s Messenger, upon whom be peace, brought from his Lord.
