var content = "(See Snake | Sting)Hi my sister just told me she had a dream that I was in. In the dream we all see snakes but my sister saba who is 15 plays around with the snake and is not afraid. I on the other hand have already been bitten by one as I say in the dream. We then return home in the dream and there is a black snake on the fireplace and that bites me too. My little sister selina who is 12 had the dream.  Do you have any idea what this may imply as I previously had a dream about snakes around a week ago. Am I in some sort of trouble. If you could let me know I would be very grateful ";
