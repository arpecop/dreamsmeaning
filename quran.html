var content = "(Garden | Holy Book | The Last Revelation) In a dream, the holy Qur’an represents a garden because when one looks at it, it looks like a beautiful garden and its verses are the fruit of knowledge and wisdom the reader can pluck. Learning a Qur’anic verse, a saying of God’s Prophet (uwbp), a prophetic tradition, or a craft in a dream means richness after poverty, or guidance after heedlessness. If one sees himself in a dream reading from the pages the holy Qur’an, it signifies honor, command, happiness and victory. Reciting the Qur’an by heart and without reading the pages of the holy Book in a dream means proving to be true, or having a true claim, being pious, commanding what is good and forbidding what is evil. If one is told averse from the holy Qur’an in a dream, he should understand it, memorize it and comply with the same. If the verse reads about mercy or glad tidings or other admonitions in the dream, the interpretation of one’s dream should be the same. If the Qur’anic verses recited in the dream connote an advice, one should act upon it in order for him to reap its benefits. If one hears a Qur’anic verse containing a warning, promising punishment for the disbelievers, or announcing a swift retribution for their sins, then one should immediately repent for his sins, even if the verses relate to previous nations or times. If one sees himself reciting the Qur’an and under- standing what it says in a dream, it denotes his vigilance, intelligence, faith and spiritual awareness. If a Qur’anic verse is recited to someone, and if he does not agree with the divine judgement in the dream, it means that he will suffer harm from someone in authority, or that a punishment from God Almighty will soon befall him. If an unlettered person sees himself reading the holy Qur’an in a dream, it could also mean his death, or his reading of his own records. If one sees himself reading the holy Qur’an without true interest in it in a dream, it means that he follows his own mind, personal interpretations and innovations. If one sees himself eating the pages of the holy Qur’an in a dream, it means that he earns his livelihood from his knowledge of it. If one sees himself completing the reading of the entire Qur’an in a dream, it means that a splendid reward from his Lord is awaiting him, and that he will get whatever he asks for. If a disbeliever sees himself reading the holy Qur’an in a dream, the verses of admonition will help him in his life, the verses of punishment will be his warning from God Almighty and the parables will denote his need to contemplate the meaning. If one sees himself writing the verses of the holy Qur’an on slabs of a mother of pearl, or on a piece of cloth in a dream, it means that he interprets it according to his own liking. If one sees himself inscribing a Qur’anic verse on the ground in a dream, it means that he is an atheist. It is also said that reading the Qur’an in a dream means fulfillment of one’s needs, clearing of one’s heart and establishment of one’s success in his life. If one discovers that he has memorized the Qur’an in a dream, though in wakefulness he has not memorized it, it means that he will own a large property. Hearing the verses of the holy Qur’an in a dream means the strengthening of one’s power, reaching a praiseworthy end to his life, and that one will be protected from the envy and jealousy of evildoing people. If a sick person sees himself reciting a verse from the holy Qur’an, but could not remember to what chapter it belongs in the dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. Licking the holy Qur’an in a dream means that one has committed a major sin. Reciting the holy Qur’an in a dream means increase in one’s good deeds and rising in his station.
