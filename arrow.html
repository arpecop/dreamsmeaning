var content = "If you see an arrow in your dream, it represents how you can achieve something you are looking for. This dream symbolizes your doubts you are having and the disbalance. If you dream of fractured or old arrow it represents frustration and failure in the future. This is a sign that you might think of something not the same way as you used to think before about something specific. If you see arrow with two heads, it means that there is a contract between your thoughts. Make sure you think of all views. The school of psychologists explains an arrow as symbol of penis and its ability to get through.";
