var content = "(God’s prophet Jesus son of Mary, upon both of them be peace.) One who sees God’s prophet Jesus upon whom be peace, in a dream is a blessed man, a generous one, an ascetic who pleases his Lord, who is filled with contentment, who travels excessively and may acquire knowledge about medicine and herbs. It is said that whoever sees Jesus in a dream will be protected against calamities for that year. If he asks or wishes for something, he will receive it, and if he learns a trade, he will become successful at it. One who sees Jesus upon whom be peace, in a dream will become an ascetic, travels throughout the land, escape from his enemy and may become a renowned physician. If one sees Jesus son of Mary in a town looking into people’s conditions, it means that calamities will be lifted away from that place, and people will live in peace and tranquility for a while. If one sees him together with his mother, upon both of them be peace, it means that a great miracle, or a sign of divine magnitude will manifest in that location. If one sees himself in a dream as Jesus (uwbp), or if he wears one of his garments, or performs a duty suitable for God’s prophet, it means that he will rise in rank. If he is a scholar, it means that his knowledge will be widely spread and his virtues and servitude will benefit others, or if one is a physician, it means that he will become renowned and most successful. If one who sees him is struck by fear and reverence in his dream, it means honor, power and blessing wherever he may go. If a sick person sees him in a dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. If one sees Jesus sick, it means one’s own death. In general, to see Jesus in a dream means miraculous events, social justice and economic growth. If a pregnant woman sees Jesus upon whom be peace, in her dream, it means that she will beget a child who will grow to become a physician. Seeing Jesus upon whom be peace in a dream also could denote doubt about one’s religion, philosophical disputes or a discord. Seeing him in a dream also signify the rise of some of his followers. If one sees Jesus in a dream, he could be accused of something of which he is innocent, or that someone may lie to him or slander his mother. Seeing Jesus and his mother, upon both of them be peace in a dream also could mean distress, sorrow, defamation, moving from one country into another, or it could mean miracles. Seeing Jesus upon whom be peace in a dream also means glad tidings, for he was the last of God’s prophets who gave the glad tidings and spoke of God’s Messenger Muhammad, upon whom be peace, as the praiseworthy comforter. (Poclete | Proclytos. See John 14-15&#x2F;18, 25&#x2F;26, 29&#x2F;30) Seeing Jesus upon whom be peace in a dream also means answering one’s prayers, or wrath against people from the upper social class, or against those who challenged him to bring down a table of food from the heavens then had doubt about God’s power again. Seeing him in a dream also represents bounty, good luck, or having good friends. If a child sees Jesus in a dream, it could mean that he will grow up as an orphan, or be reared by his mother and live as a scholar and a righteous person, or he may travel frequently between Syria and Egypt. If one who is impotent, or sterile sees him in a dream, it means that he will regain his fertility and fruition. If one sees Jesus upon whom be peace descending upon a town, it means that justice and righteousness will prevail and permeate that place, as it will be when he shall, by God’s leave, descends upon the earth to kill the impostor (Antichrist) and destroy his followers, obliterate infidelity, and he shall fill the earth with justice, blessings and lend victory to the believers.";
