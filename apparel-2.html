var content = "(Adornment | Attire | Costume | Garb | Veil) In a dream, one’s apparel vary in meaning depending on their contents, colors or type, etcetera. Wearing one’s garb in the winter in a dream is better than wearing it in the summer. Wrapping oneself with a cloth in a dream means becoming poor. An attire in a dream represents a man and a leader. An attire for a scholar, or a merchant, or a leader in a dream represents his trade through which one earns his livelihood and which protects him from adversities. If one’s apparel is dirty in the dream, then it reflects his life and appearance. If one wears a beautiful garb in the summertime in a dream, it means that he is ostentatious, arrogant and vainglorious. It also could mean that he is under great pressure and suffering from a painful distress, for the heat of a summer in a dream signifies distress. If a woman sees herself wearing a man’s apparel in a dream, it means piety and success in her material and spiritual life. If a man sees himself wearing a woman’s apparel in a dream, it means that he will be afflicted with fear, depression, subjugation, humiliation, trials, then all of it will be lifted away from him. (Also see Veil | Yashmak)";
