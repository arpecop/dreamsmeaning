var content = "(Death | Punishment) In a dream, crucifixion means exaltation of the one who is put on the cross, or a high rank he will attain. If one who qualifies for a leadership position sees himself crucified in a dream, it means that he will attain his goals. If he dies of his crucifixion in the dream, it means that he will lose faith or fail to apply the divine laws in his life. If he is crucified in the dream and does not die from it, it means that he will rule with justice. If an average person sees himself crucified in a dream, it means that he will be humiliated and suppressed. If one sees himself raised to be crucified after he had died in a dream, it means that he will attain worldly status, though remains morally defiled and religiously corrupt. If one sees himself crucified and did not know when was he put on the cross in a dream, it means that he will recover lost property or money, or fulfill his goals. If one is crucified after being killed in the dream, it means that someone will lie to him, despite his high rank. If one eats the flesh of a crucified person in a dream, it means that he will backbite him. If blood comes out of the flesh of a crucified person in a dream, it means that he is recruited to cause harm. If one eats the flesh of a crucified person in a dream, it means that he will travel in the mail wagon or on a cargo ship. If one sees himself riding in the mail wagon in a dream, it means that he will shortly die. If one is crucified on the walls of a city and people are watching him in a dream, it means that he will rise in station and rank and that he will command strong men. If he bleeds in the dream, it means that his subjects draw benefits from him. Crucifixion of a poor person in a dream means richness, while for a rich person, it means revelations about his business dealings, exposure of his true character, defamation, or it could mean poverty. As for an unwed person, crucifixion in a dream means getting married.";
