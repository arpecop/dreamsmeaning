var content = "(Icy rain) In a dream, hail means calamity, sufferings, hunger, loss of property, poverty, mass persecution, or torture. In nature, this element cools the earth and eliminates many harmful insects, worms or scorpions and limits the danger of snakes. Thus, seeing hail in its proper season in a dream means eliminating the source of one’s stress and overcoming one’s difficulties, enemies, or jealous competitors. Seeing hail in the summertime in a dream means business losses, but if it falls in the winter in a dream, it means success and prosperity. Heavy falling hail in a dream means destruction of businesses, interruption of communication and damage to roads and highways. In that sense, hail in a dream means obstruction of public interests. In a dream, hail also represents a strange type of business that will come from the direction of the wind carrying such a storm. If no harm occurs in one’s dream, then hail represents glad tidings and especially if people start collecting it in bowls. If hail falls over a farmland without damaging it in a dream, it means a good harvest. If one gathers hail in his garment, or inside a cloth in a dream, it means that he will lose his riches, or it could mean the loss of an awaited shipment. (Also see Dew | Ice)";
