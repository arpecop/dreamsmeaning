var content = "(Anger | Ascertain | Cold | Disdain | Disregard | Exhale | Fury) Sneezing in a dream means reassessing something about which one had doubt. Thus, sneezing in a dream could mean acknowledging the truth, and that is why people’s common reply is “God bless you.” Sneezing in a dream also could mean the death of a sick person, or experiencing agony, distress, adversities, or facing a disturbing problem. If one who is experiencing such trials sees himself sneezing in a dream, it means that the time has come to dispel them. If a poor person sneezes in a dream, it means that he may wake up to find that help is coming his way. Sneezing in a dream also could mean paying one’s debts, or recovering from a cold or a nasal congestion, or it could mean exasperation, fury, rage, anger, or frowning. If one sneezes with force in his dream, it means that he should beware of a strong enemy and the possibility of suffering losses at his hands.";
