var content = "Dreaming of lambs frolicing{sic} in green pastures, betokens chaste friendships and joys. Bounteous and profitable crops to the farmers, and increase of possessions for others. To see a dead lamb, signifies sadness and desolation. Blood showing on the white fleece of a lamb, denotes that innocent ones will suffer from betrayal through the wrong doing of others. A lost lamb, denotes that wayward people will be under your influence, and you should be careful of your conduct. To see lamb skins, denotes comfort and pleasure usurped from others. To slaughter a lamb for domestic uses, prosperity will be gained through the sacrifice of pleasure and contentment. To eat lamb chops, denotes illness, and much anxiety over the welfare of children. To see lambs taking nourishment from their mothers, denotes happiness through pleasant and intelligent home companions, and many lovable and beautiful children. Dreaming that dogs, or wolves devour lambs, innocent people will suffer at the hands of insinuating and designing villains. To hear the bleating of lambs, your generosity will be appealed to. To see them in a winter storm, or rain, denotes disappointment in expected enjoyment and betterment of fortune. To own lambs in your dreams, signifies that your environments will be pleasant and profitable. If you carry lambs in your arms, you will be encumbered with happy cares upon which you will lavish a wealth of devotion, and no expense will be regretted in responding to appeals from the objects of your affection. To shear lambs, shows that you will be cold and mercenary. You will be honest, but inhumane. For a woman Dreaming that she is peeling the skin from a lamb, and while doing so, she discovers that it is her child, denotes that she will cause others sorrow which will also rebound to her grief and loss. Fair prototype of innocence, Sleep upon thy emerald bed, No coming evil vents A shade above thy head. See Sheep. ";
