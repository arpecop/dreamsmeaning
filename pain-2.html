Neck pain in a dream represents being ill- treated by one’s friends. Neck pain in a dream also may indicate that one has betrayed his covenant, or that he has denied a promise. Shoulder pain in a dream signifies bad earnings. Stomach pain in a dream means spending money in sin and feeling regret for doing so. Pain in one’s navel in a dream signifies ill-treatment of one’s wife. Heart pain in a dream means having hidden bad qualities, or questionable religious sincerity. Liver pain in a dream means ill- treatment of one’s children. Spleen pain in a dream means spoiling one’s money by adding unlawful earnings to it. Severe spleen pain that could lead to one’s death in the dream means loss of one’s religious commitment. Lung and chest pain in a dream mean the nearing of one’s death. Back pain in a dream means the death of one’s brother, supporter, superior, or a close friend. Pain in one’s thighs in a dream means causing harm to one’s community.
