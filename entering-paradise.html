var content = "If one sees himself entering the heavenly paradise in a dream, then his dream represents glad tidings that God willing, he shall enter it. If a pilgrim sees himself entering paradise in a dream, it means that his pilgrimage is accepted or that he will reach God’s House in Mecca. If he lacks faith in God Almighty, it means that he will become a believer. If a believer who is bed- stricken sees himself entering paradise in a dream, it means that he will die of his illness. If a non-believer who is bed-stricken sees himself entering paradise in a dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. If he is unwed, it means that he will get married. If he is poor, it means that he will become rich or receive an inheritance. If a sick person sees himself in the abode of the hereafter healthy again in a dream, it means that he will reach it free from the ills of this world, its adversities and temptations. If he is not sick, then entering the realms of the hereafter means glad tidings, business success, a pilgrimage, ascetic detachment from this world, sincere devotion, acquiring knowledge, strengthening of one’s kinship or exercising patience toward a calamity which derives from one’s own sins. If one sees himself entering the abode of the hereafter to visit and see around, and should he be a person of good deeds and character who is a capable person and who acts upon his knowledge, it means that he will be without work or suffer from business losses. If he is scared of something, or if he is accused of something, or if he is under stress, it means that his fears will dissipate. Mostly, entering the abode of the hereafter in a dream means travels or migration from one’s homeland. Thus, if one sees himself returning from a journey to the hereafter in a dream, it means that he will return to his homeland. Entering paradise in a dream means a pilgrimage to God’s House in Mecca.";
