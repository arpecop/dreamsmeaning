var content = "Dreaming that you are naked, foretells scandal and unwise engagements. To see others naked, foretells that you will be tempted by designing persons to leave the path of duty. Sickness will be no small factor against your success. Dreaming that you suddenly discover your nudity, and are trying to conceal it, denotes that you have sought illicit pleasure contrary to your noblest instincts and are desirous of abandoning those desires. For a young woman Dreaming that she admires her nudity, foretells that she will win, but not hold honest men’s regard. She will win fortune by her charms. If she thinks herself ill-formed, her reputation will be sullied by scandal. If she dreams of swimming in clear water naked, she will enjoy illicit loves, but nature will revenge herself by sickness, or loss of charms. If she sees naked men swimming in clear water, she will have many admirers. If the water is muddy, a jealous admirer will cause ill-natured gossip about her. ";
