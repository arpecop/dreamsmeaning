var content = "(Hand) Fingers help one’s worldly needs or craft and serve one’s benefits in the hereafter by identifying and pointing at what is true and identifying what is wrong. In general, fingers in a dream represent one’s children, wife, father, mother, money, property, wealth or craft. Positive looking fingers or increase in their number in a dream represents growth, while deformed fingers in a dream mean the opposite. One’s five fingers in a dream also represent the five daily prayers. Thus, if the fingers are interpreted to mean the five daily obligatory prayers, then the fingernails represent the supererogatory (arb. Nafl) prayers. If the fingers are interpreted as money, then the fingernails represent the due alms tax arb. Zakat). If they are interpreted to represent an army in the dream, then the fingernails represent their weapons. Fingers in a dream also represent the days, months or years. When fingers are interpreted to mean money, and if someone cuts off his finger in a dream, it means that he will suffer from financial losses. Long fingers in a dream are regarded as greed. (Also see Body 1 | Five fingers | Thimble)";
