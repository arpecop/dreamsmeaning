var content = "If one sees them in a good state in a dream, it means that he will attain his goals, be it profits, knowledge, guidance or uprightness. A governor in a dream also represents an orthopedist, an engineer, gentleness or conformity. If a governor sees himself hearing a petition from a deranged person, a stupid person, a street sweeper, a baker, a trash collector, a servant, a dancer or a musician in a dream, it means that the governor will consent to the opinions or advice of others in his ruling, or perhaps he will lean toward the interests of some opportunists. A governor in a dream also represents a father or a mother who teach their children justice and righteousness and in turn, the child will benefit from them and particularly if he follows their advice.
