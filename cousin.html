var content = "Dreaming of one’s cousin, denotes disappointments and afflictions. Saddened lives are predicted by this dream. Dreaming of an affectionate correspondence with one’s cousin, denotes a fatal rupture between families. My cousin passed from cancer on 5&#x2F;4&#x2F;14. i had a dream that she came to me, and was very weak, as I was helping her with her infant she wouldnt let me hold him and she dropped him in the bath water. ( that is how much she was weak but she was to stubborn to let me help). Then there was a funeral that she got up and said, no I am not gonna let this happen. She got up out of the casket (again very weak) was sitting sleeping.. the dream kinda went on and she passed away again. this time my mom(which she disliked) was there, her mom which is my moms sister, and me was sitting on a bench and my aunt asked her where the hankerchief was that my great grandma used at my great grandpas funeral, then my grandma used it at her funeral, and my aunt used it at her funeral, and my aunt gave it to my mom and was asking for it back for her daughters funeral. ( there is no hankercheif in real life, this is in my dream) ?? then we went back into the funeral home where her ex husband had destroyed her funeral, broke all flowers and arrangements and pulled her out of the casket and was kissing her. I am so destraught over this dream, anyone have a clue?";
