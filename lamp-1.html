var content = "(Candle | Flame | Light | Torch) If a pregnant woman sees herself carrying a lamp in a dream, it means that she will beget a son. As for a sick person, a lamp represents his life. If the lamp is dimmed in the dream, it means his death. If one sees himself repairing a lamp in a dream, it means that he will recover from an illness. A lamp with a weak battery, or low electrical current represents health problems for a pregnant woman. A strong lamp that lights one’s entire house denotes righteousness in that house. If one turns off the light in his house in a dream, it denotes the suspicious character of the owner, his financial troubles, his death, the death of a father, a mother, a wife, a child or a sick person. If one sees a sick person rising to the sky and carrying a lamp in a dream, it means the return of his soul to its Lord. If one draws light from someone else’s lamp in a dream, it means that he will acquire knowledge. Extinguishing the light of an oil lamp in a dream means attempting to conceal the truth by opposing a truthful witness, yet he will fail to win his case. Carrying a lighted lamp in the daylight in a dream represents a religious and a righteous person. Walking with a lamp during the night in a dream means observing a night vigil and prayers. If such a person is religious by nature, then it represents benefits. Otherwise, it means that he will see wonders. Carrying a lamp at night in a dream also means repentance from one’s sins. Carrying an unlit lamp, candle, or torch in a dream means business losses, or problems at the workplace. If one sees a lamp filled with oil that does not burn in a dream, it means sorrow and distress. (Also see Lamp stand | Wick)";
