var content = "An invitation to lunch or dinner in a dream means taking a long journey. If in the mid-afternoon, it signifies a rest or taking a break from a troubling job. If it is an invitation to dinner in the dream, it means betraying someone under the cover of darkness. If one sees himself planning to invite people to a lunch or to dinner in a dream, it means that he wants to do business with them, or perhaps enter their circles. Consequently, he will be blamed for interfering or entering such a venture. If one sees himself hosting a dinner at his house, and the guests have finished eating in the dream, it means that he will preside over them. If a sick person sees such an invitation at his house in a dream, it means that he will recover from his illness. Serving food to guests in a dream means the returning home of a dear person from a long journey. If one sees himself sitting at a table covered with all types of food and fruits in a dream, it means that he will be called upon to serve his Lord and to win paradise. (Also see Food | Guest | Hospitality | Table)";
