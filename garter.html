var content = "For a lover to find his lady’s garter, foretells that he will lose caste with her. He will find rivals. For a woman dreaming that she loses her garter, signifies that her lover will be jealous and suspicious of a handsomer person. For a married man dreaming of a garter, foretells that his wife will hear of his clandestine attachments, and he will have a stormy scene. For a woman dreaming that she is admiring beautiful jeweled garters on her limbs, denotes that she will be betrayed in her private movements, and her reputation will hang in the balance of public opinion. If she dreams that her lover fastens them on her, she will hold his affections and faith through all adverse criticisms. ";
