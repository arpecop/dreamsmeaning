var content = "(Inn | Hotel | Lodge | Pub) In a dream, a hostel represents fornication, adultery, temporary marriage for pleasure, renting a space, renting tools or machinery, leasing an area for storage, or renting a garment. If a sick person rents a room in a hostel or an inn on the highway in a dream, it means his death, or it could mean that he will recover from an illness, or dispel anxiety, or take residence in a new country, or it could mean marriage after being single for a long time, or buying a vehicle, finding a money pouch, or something one can sell to help him during his financial crises. A married person resting in a hostel in a dream means that he will beget a son who when he grows will help his father in his trade and bring him happiness and comfort. If one’s child is disobedient, or recalcitrant, it means that he will repent and come back to live under his father or mother. If a heedless person sees a hostel in a dream, it means that he will find guidance and return to walk on God’s path. (Also see Hotel)";
