var content = "In a dream, a spool means keeping one’s secrets, or it could represent a gracious man, or a trustworthy person who lends his help to others and benefits them in their worldly affairs. If one sees himself carrying a spool while taking his ritual ablution in a dream, it means that he will seek the help of a righteous believer who holds fast to the rope of God Almighty. In that sense, a spool represents the element of religious life and the rope in a dream signifies religion, which is one’s connection to his Lord. Carrying a spool when performing one’s ablution in a dream means that one will be permanently cured from ills and become free from debts. A spool in a dream also means an active servant, or a talkative son. (Also see Ball of thread | Rope)";
