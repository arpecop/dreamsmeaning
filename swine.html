var content = "(Pig) In a dream, a swine represents an avowed and a fierce enemy who is perfidious, worrisome, anxious, who does not act upon what he says and who lies and tricks people. Riding a swine in a dream means that he will earn a large some of money. If one eats it raw, cooked, or broiled in the dream, it means that he swallows unlawful money, or knowingly eats impermissible food. Walking like a swine in a dream means turning quick profits from an investment or a business, or it could mean that one will acquire what his heart desires. A wild pig in dream is a sign of a severe cold weather. Eating ham in a dream carries benefits for all people, though it is unlawful for Muslims. If one sees a pig in his bed in a dream, it means that he will commit adultery. Little pigs in a dream represent adversities and distress for their owner, or for the person seeing the dream. A domesticated swine in a dream means good harvest, prosperity, or satisfying one’s needs and desires. Seeing a swine in a dream also may mean presiding over people of opposing or diverse opinions, or it could mean divorce, evil happenings, spendthrift, acquiring demonic nature, earning illegal money, or having a large progeny. If a pig causes harm to someone in a dream, it represents the perfidy of one’s rival. Swine’s milk in a dream represents a heartbreaking loss of money, or it could mean committing a major sin. If one sees little pigs entering his house in a dream, it represents an official inspection of one’s private life. If one sees himself kicking little pigs out of his house in a dream, it means that he will resign from working for the government.";
