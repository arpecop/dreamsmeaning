var content = "(Claim | Search | Wanted) In a dream, pursuit means one’s destiny, or death. If one sees himself wanted by his enemy in a dream, it means that he may die shortly. On the other hand, pursuit in a dream also could represent things that foster one’s pride, such as knowledge, schooling, degrees, money, or work. If one sees himself pursued by someone in a dream, it means sorrow and distress. Pursuit in a dream also represents one’s goal in life. If one is not a fugitive, then to see himself wanted in a dream means appeasement of his fears. If one sees an ugly looking person searching for him in a dream, he then represents an unwanted catastrophe, or a mishap. If one is caught by his claimant, then it means increase of his fears. If one sees himself pursuing something, or seeking to get something in a dream, it means that he will attain his goal or at least a part of it.";
