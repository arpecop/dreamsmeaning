var content = "(Rock) A discarded stone in a dream represents a dead person. It could also represent people with hardened hearts, heedless, or jobless people. It is common among the people of knowledge to describe an ignorant person as a stone. Owning a precious stone in a dream could mean buying one in wakefulness, or it may mean gaining a strong foothold over someone of the same caliber, or it could mean a marriage to a compatible person. If one sees himself petrified in a dream, it means that he disobeys his Lord, in that sense, if he is sick, it means that he may die from his illness, or he may be inflicted with a stroke that will leave him paralyzed. A falling stone over the world in a dream means the wrath of God Almighty, a calamity, or that an unjust person will rule the land. If the stone splits asunder or explodes after falling in the dream, it means that the harm will touch every house. Carrying bags full of stones or moving mountains in a dream means attempting to do something difficult. Hanging a stone around one’s neck as a charm in a dream means that an affliction or an evil will take place. If a poor person sees himself hitting a rock with a staff to split it, then if water gushes forth in the dream, it means that he will strike it rich. Stones in a dream also may represent devotion, asceticism, or godly people. If a godly person or an ascetic sees himself possessing a stone in a dream, it means that the blessings he receives will show in his community, and people will seek him to pray for their needs. Owning a wheat grinding stone, a juicer, porphyry, or any therapeutic or medicinal stones in a dream represent a respected or a revered person such as one’s father, one’s master, teacher, shaikh, friend, relative, physician, gnostic, a learned person, honorable people, a property, comfort, profits, benefits, or a rewarding trade. Such stones also may be interpreted as extensive travels. (Also see Pebbles | Rocks)";
