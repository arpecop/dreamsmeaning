var content = "(Build | Contour | Frame | Profile) Having a tall figure in a dream signifies pride, arrogance, stinginess, ostentatiousness or pretending to be tall. (See Tallness). If one sees his figure shorter than his normal size in a dream, then it denotes losing respect or nearing the end of one’s life. Seeing oneself beyond the common human size in a dream also denotes the near end of one’s life, or it could mean falling in rank. If someone in authority sees himself shorter in size in a dream, it means that he will lose his post, or fail to render a just verdict, or it could mean a political fight. Being smaller than usual in a dream means defeat in a war or losing a fight. If a politician sees himself tall in a dream, it means that he will win his political battle. (Also see Body’)";
