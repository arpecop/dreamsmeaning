This dream could be a sign of the risk being out of proportion. Maybe there is something you are not sure about and lost connection with truthfulness. This dream wants to show you that you should take a break, go away even if it’s just for a few days. If you dream of breathing a hot air it means that there are too much of negative energy around you, be aware of that and make sure you are attentive to people around you.";
