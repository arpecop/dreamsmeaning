var content = "(God’s prophet Solomon, upon whom be peace.) God Almighty subju- gated the wind to serve the prophet Solomon. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream denotes leadership, the seat of a judge, acquiring wisdom, or giving religious interpretations if the person who sees him in a dream qualifies. This vision becomes stronger if the Prophet Solomon crowns the person, or places a ring on his right hand, or sits him beside himself on his throne. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also means overcoming adversities and hardships, and receiving a divine endowment of an exalted station in this world, and greater blessings in the hereafter. Seeing him (uwhp) in a dream also means trials with women and ingratitude on their part. If the person who sees God’s prophet Solomon in a dream is a governor, it means that he will be dismissed from his functions, though his authority will be restored later on, or he could through cheating, marry a rich woman. If the one who sees God’s prophet Solomon in a dream practices sorcery, witchcraft, black magic, or invoking jinn or evil spirits, it means that he will profit from his trade and become wealthy after having lost hope in attaining such benefits, or he could triumph over his enemy. Whoever sees God’s prophet Solomon (uwbp) in his dream will receive God’s favors, including clear visions, clarity of religious interpretations, the ability to learn many languages, or he could become a translator, or perhaps could master the Arabic language. Seeing Solomon in a dream also means that one will recover from an illness. If one gets hold of Solomon’s staff in a dream, it means that he will engage in slander or calumny, and if he is sick, it means his death. Seeing or finding Solomon’s ring in a dream means renewing one’s term of leadership, or a manifestation of a great and a confounding wonder that will bewilder people. If a woman sees God’s prophet Solomon (uwbp) in a dream, it means that she will deceive her husband. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also means that one may acquire knowledge about herbal medicine. If one sees him laying dead on his bed in a dream, it means that the calif, an army commander, a leader, or a man of knowledge will die in that locality and whose death will remain undetected, or undisclosed for sometime. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also means increase in one’s travels, supremacy over one’s enemy and subjugation of one’s friends and foes to his orders should he qualify. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also denotes riches, sovereignty, distant but fast travels and receiving blessings, peace and protection. (Also see Solomon’s ring)";
