var content = "(Mud) To sink, stick, or walk in mire in a dream means fear, distress, difficulties and adversities. The same interpretation is given for muddling in the rainwaters, or walking in the rain. If a sick person sees mire in his dream, it means sufferingfrom a prolonged illness. Walking out of mire in a dream means recovering from an illness. Walking in mire in a dream also means imprison- ment, poverty, or sufferings caused by one’s sinfulness and lack of attending to his religious duties. If a woman sees mire in her dream, it may mean that she may shortly conceive a child. In a dream, mire also means stagnation, disrupting communications, the past, pride about one’s wealth, or it could mean apostasy. If the color of mud turns from black into red in a dream, it means moving from one’s country to another, or from one wife to another. During a drought, if one sees mire or mud in his dream, it means rain. Mire inside a well in a dream means an inheritance, or the surfacing of blessings, or any related interpre- tations to what a well represents in a dream.";
