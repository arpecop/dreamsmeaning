var content = "(Blessed tree) In a dream, olives represent money, pleasures, or one’s prosperity. An olive tree in a dream represents a blessed man who benefits his family, a chaste woman, or it could mean a son who may become a governor. A yellow olive in a dream represents heavy concerns about one’s religious life. If one presses olives for oil in a dream, it means that he will earn blessings and benefits. If one sees himself watering an olive tree with olive oil in a dream, it means that he sleeps with his mother. The same interpretation applies if one sees himself watering a garden with vinegar. If one buys an olive tree, or eats from one, or drinks from its oil in a dream, it means blessings, or that he will marry a noble and a chaste woman. Seeing the leaves of an olive tree in a dream means following the straight path, or fulfilling one’s spiritual obligations, guidance, light, reading the Qur’an, comforting someone’s heart, making money for a poor person, except if one eats the olive raw in the dream, then it means the opposite, or it implies poverty, indebtedness, or it could denote the place, or the direction it comes from. The leaves of an olive tree represent righteous people or spiritual leaders. The fruit of an olive tree represents easy money, or living a rich and a happy life. Selecting olives or pressing them for oil in a dream means toiling, or hardships. As for a sick person, olives in a dream mean regaining strength and recovering from his illness. The fruit itself and the leaves also denote assiduousness and resoluteness, however, olives in a dream also denote slow growing. (Also see Oil)cuting of trees";
