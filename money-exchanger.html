var content = "In a dream, a money exchanger represents knowledge, poetry, speaking the right words, richness after poverty, a school, the fellowship of a wise man, or a scale. In a dream, a money exchanger also could represent someone who has knowledge, though no one benefit from what he knows except in mundane matters. His work relates to scientific writings, scientific argu- ments, dispute of authority, or questions and answers. Perhaps his only balance or criterion is his own judgment. His balance represents his tongue and ears. His weights are his only instrument for justice and judgment. His measuring pennies are his fights with people. A money exchanger in a dream also represents a religious doctor or a scholar who takes religious questions and interprets their definitions. He also could be a dream interpreter who measures everything he takes in and gives an appropriate answer. He takes a pearl necklace for a price and gives words in return, or he takes scattered words and gives a beautiful pearl necklace in exchange. If one who is experiencing difficulties in wakefulness changes some money in a dream, it means that his difficulties will diminish. If one buys gold coins and gives silver money in exchange in a dream, it means reparation, financial obligations or liability. Seeing a money exchanger in a dream also represents wealth, or quick richness from suspicious sources, or he could represent an accountant, a bookkeeper, or a ledger keeper.";
