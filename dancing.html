var content = "Dancing in a dream means a calamity. If one sees himself dancing for someone else in a dream, it means that he will share his problems with him. Dancing alone in one’s house in a dream signifies joy and satisfaction. If a sick person sees himself dancing in a dream, it denotes his anxiety. If one is pulled to a dancing circle in a dream, it means that he will be saved from tribulation or be declared innocent from false allegations. If a child is seen dancing in a dream, then it means that he may lose his speech or become dumb, because when a child dances, he mostly moves his hands to express himself. If a prisoner sees himself dancing in a dream, it means that he will be set free. Dancing on top of a table, a raised stage or on top of a hill in a dream means a scare. Dancing inside one’s house, surrounded with one’s family members with no outsiders in a dream means joy and celebration. If a sick person sees himself dancing in a dream, it means longevity. Seeing a woman dancing alone in a dream means a scandal. If a traveller sees himself dancing on the road in a dream, it means adversities. If a poor person sees himself dancing in a dream, it means richness. (Also see Dancer)";
