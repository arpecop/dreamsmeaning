var content = "(God’s prophet Joseph, upon whom be peace | arb. Yiisuf) Seeing God’s prophet Joseph (uwbp) in a dream means attaining high rank or a vice-regency. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also could denote a time of rising prices, drought, loss of one’s family, or suffering from people’s stratagem, entering a prison, then be released by God’s grace. It also denotes one’s luck with women and adversities related to one’s beauty and good character. Seeing God’s prophet Joseph in a dream also means acquiring knowledge about dream interpretation, or catching one’s enemy, then forgiving him, or digging a river, a water irrigation, or transporting dead people from one country to another. It also could represent a great advent or a miracle by the fact that he (uwbp) had performed a miracle by God’s leave and returned his father’s sight. Joseph’s shirt in a dream means dispelling distress, sorrows and recovering from illness. If the shirt is spotted with blood in the dream, then it means separation and imprisonment. If his shirt is torn from the back in the dream, it means a false accusation. If a woman sees Joseph (uwbp) in a dream, it means that she will lose her comfort and sight. She will also live unhappy because of her separation from her beloved, and she will fall in love with a great man. If the woman who is actually suffering from such adversity sees such a dream, it means that God Almighty will turn to her with mercy and guide her to repentance. If she is unmarried, it means that she will get married. If she is poor, it means that she will become rich, and her life in this world as well as in the hereafter will turn to her advantage. Seeing Joseph (uwbp) as a young boy in a dream means having little or no luck with one’s brethren. He will be lied to, suffer from imprisonment and other trials before he recuperates, to rise and triumph over them. They will all then become his subject. One who sees God’s prophet Joseph (uwbp) in a dream will also be a pious, generous, charitable, and shares his good advice with those who need it, or ask for it. If Joseph (uwbp) talks to someone, or gives him something in a dream, it means that one will understand dream interpretations and learn about Chronicles, or the two biblical books of History. Seeing him (uwbp) in a dream also means marriage to a beautiful woman who will truly love her husband. (Also see Jacob | Sale | Introduction p.p. xvi, xvii, xuiii)";
