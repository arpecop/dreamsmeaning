var content = "(Argillite | Argillateous | Mortar | Mud | Plaster) In a dream, clay means sickness, disgrace or ignominy, except for one who works with clay or builds structures with it, then in his case, seeing clay in his dream means benefits, religious awareness and developing faith and certitude. Dry clay in a dream represents a cut in one’s earnings or living on a budget. If one sees himself plastering the walls of his house with wet clay in a dream, it means that he is a righteous person. If one sees himself eating clay in a dream, it means that he swindles money. Construction clay in a dream means benefits and money. Seeing clay in a dream also could mean death. If one sees himself waking in mud or wet clay, and if he works with it in a dream, it means falling sick or suffering from disgrace. Dry clay in a dream means money, while wet clay means righteousness. Eating baked clay in a dream means backbiting others, untruth or slander. If a sick person sees clay in his dream, it means his death. (Also see Bricks)";
