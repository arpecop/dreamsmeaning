var content = "(Carbonize | Charcoal | Fuel) Burning coal in a dream means immediate earnings or a ready to fill order for one’s merchandise. If one can benefit from it in his dream, it means easy benefits or receiving jewelry as a gift, or having a type of work in which one needs to use coal. Seeing burning coal in a dream also means seeking knowledge and wisdom. Coal in a dream also represents an evil and a dangerous person, or it could mean tainted money, unlawful earnings or receiving a grant from someone in the government. Burning coal in a dream also denotes someone who is unjustly suffering from hardships and trials or someone who’s property is unjustly confiscated. Consumed or burned up coal in a dream means the same thing as ashes and signifies falsehood. Having large cuts of coal when one needs small pieces in a dream means worries, distress and concerns, while having fine crushed coal when one needs chunks to light a fire in a dream means diminishing of one’s wealth . Seeing coal or charcoal in a dream also could mean increase or rejuvenation of one’s sexual desires. Seeing coal in the winter in a dream means money. Fuel for the fire in a dream means corruption. (Also see Ashes)";
