var content = "(Rod | Wand | Scepter | Stick) In a dream, a staff represents a distinctive, strong, generous and a helpful person. Holding a staff in a dream means depending on a person who also carries some imprints of hypocrisy. Through such a person, one will attain his goals, gain strength and overcome his enemy. Leaning on a hollow staff in a dream means losing one’s wealth and keeping it a secret. If the staff of a governor, or a leader, or a manager is broken in a dream, it means that he will lose his post. If he is a merchant, it means that he will lose his business. If one sees himself hitting the ground with his staff in a dream, it means that he will have control over that land, preside over its people, or triumph over the landlord. If one turns into a staff in his dream, it means a quick death. A broken staff in a dream represents a sickness that will lead to debilitation and complete loss of power. A staff in a dream also means giving orders, victory over one’s enemies, or attainment of one’s goals. If the staff is made from a branch of a palm tree in a dream, it means isolation. If it is made from a branch of an almond tree in the dream, it means banishment. If it is made from a branch of a plum tree in a dream, it means religious hypocrisy. A staff in a dream also could represent a snake or sorcery. Hitting someone with a staff in a dream means using harsh language with him. If a poor person hits a rock with his staff, and if water gushes forth from the rock in the dream, it means prosperity. If a rich person sees such a dream, it means increase in his wealth. The water that comes out of a rock in a dream also could represent sweet earnings. A wooden staff in a dream represents a vile person, or irreligious man, because wood in a dream means hypocrisy.
