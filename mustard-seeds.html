var content = "(Mustard | Money | Poison) In a dream, mustard means poison. If one eats mustard in his dream, it means that someone may poison him, or that he may fall into a vicious circle, or acquire an evil reputation. It also means that he may receive clean money, though through awesome hardships. Mustard seeds in a dream only denote good if seen by a physician. Otherwise, for the majority of people, seeing mustard or sesame seeds in a dream means a sickness, a fever, or poison.My mother dreamt this afternoon.steel box slipped from her hand and mursturd seeds have fallen on the ground. My late husband was there told her to flush them with water. Mom replied y to wash off them. Will bring them together n put it back in container. My husband was also helping her in collecting the musturd from floor. please help me in understanding the meaning of it and why my husband has come in her dreams who had passed away in a road accident six months back";
